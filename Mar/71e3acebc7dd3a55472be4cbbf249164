The search for Sushie Govender, 50, who worked in the intensive care unit at St Augustine’s Hospital, began last Wednesday. Govender, of Arena Park, was last seen at the beach on her day off from work. Her car and belongings were found in the parking area. Her husband, Rogers Govender, 53, said they searched everywhere and the canine unit was brought in. Govender believes his wife might have drowned, which was why they could not find her. “The police have been in contact with us every day and are still searching for her,” said Govender. Her sons, Diveshan, 27, and Nivashan, 18, said it was not clear what happened. ** Anyone who can help with information is urged to call Rogers at 0832351861 or Diveshan at 0662239311, Nathan at 0823205815 or Negan Palthas at 0836525874.
