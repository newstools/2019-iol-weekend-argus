The recent comments by Julius Malema that the Indian community exploits domestic workers is a practice that must stop. He further reiterates that Indians pay their domestic workers with food and clothing. I have a domestic worker who gets paid a satisfactory salary and, out of the goodness of my heart, I provide lunch and teas for her. This is not part of her remuneration - it is an Indian custom of offering and sharing meals prevalent in most Indian homes, irrespective of religious beliefs or social standing. As for clothing, my wife has offered our worker her old clothing, as she does with members of our community, family and welfare agencies. This again is not part of our agreement regarding payment. It is the spirit of charity and sharing in Indians, inculcated in us by our parents. Politicians and certain individuals have a way of poisoning people’s minds to stir unrest and anger. South Africa is a beautiful country that Madiba had dreams for. Alas, a few are killing that dream by going back to the past. Let’s move forward and work together in addressing race relations, economic freedom, service delivery and basic human rights for the people. Long live the spirit of the nation. Daily News
