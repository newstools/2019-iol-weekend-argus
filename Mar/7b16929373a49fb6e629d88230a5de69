London - The Duchess of Cambridge has admitted that she was feeling a little broody after meeting a baby on an official visit. But she said that husband Prince William might not be quite so keen to add to the couple’s family. Kate – mother to Prince George, five, Princess Charlotte, three, and Prince Louis, almost one – was enchanted by her encounter with a five-month-old boy during a walkabout in Ballymena, County Antrim, in Northern Ireland. Cooing at little James Barr, she told his father, Alan: "He’s gorgeous. It makes me feel broody." Continuing to gush, the duchess, 37, added: "You’re a very sweet little boy. Oh, he’s so diddy."   Barr asked cheekily: "Baby number four?" The duchess replied with a laugh: "I think William would be a little worried." Friends have previously said that Kate would happily have a fourth child, but William has – for the time being at least – vowed not to have any more. Kate, wearing a distinctive blue Mulberry coat with cape shoulders, and William were greeted by hundreds of cheering well-wishers on the second of their two days in Northern Ireland.
