Cape Town - More load shedding is expected this week as the power utility giant remains under pressure. Eskom said that residents are likely to experience load shedding in the days ahead. “Load shedding will be unavoidable in the coming week. There is a likelihood that we could implement stage 4 to Wednesday,” Eskom spokesperson, Andrew Etzinger said. He explained that the electricity generation system is under constraint. “We continue to appeal to residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electric appliances to assist in reducing demand,” Etzinger said. On Saturday Eskom implemented Stage 4 load shedding, and it also implemented load shedding on Sunday between 8am until 11pm. According to Eskom, the implementation of the load shedding comes due to a decline in water reserves used to supplement generation capacity. It said that it needs to manage its diesel and water resources to ensure it reduces load shedding in the week ahead. It further added that the blackouts are due to the loss of capacity, including imports from Mozambique, which is currently being affected by tropical cyclone Idai. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
