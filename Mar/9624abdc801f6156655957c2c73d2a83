Durban - A couple who were killed in a murder-suicide on Sunday night in Palmview, Phoenix have been identified by police. Zane Smith, who was self-employed, is alleged to have fatally shot his wife Bereen, an employee at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital, in the head during a domestic dispute, before turning the gun on himself. The couple's children aged 7 and 2 were in the home at the time but were unharmed. They have since moved in with relatives. Reaction Unit of SA  head Prem Balram said upon arrival the body of a woman was found lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen in an outbuilding. "She had sustained a gunshot wound to the head. The body of her husband was found in the passage. He had also sustained a gunshot wound to the head." Residents have described the couple as friendly. "He (Zane) was always smiling. We are still in shock," said one resident. Another described Bereen as timid. "They were a nice family very loving to their kids. I heard them arguing and I did not think it would lead to their deaths." Police KZN spokesperson Lt-Col Thulani Zwane said a case of murder and an inquest were opened at the Phoenix police station "A  9mm pistol was found next to the bodies. Circumstances surrounding their killing are under investigation." POST POST
