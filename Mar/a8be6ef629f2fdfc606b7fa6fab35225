Durban - Samples were taken of a red substance that was seen flowing from the stormwater drain system into the ocean at Battery Beach on Saturday. Martin Meyer, an eThekwini councillor, said he had heard reports that some bathers had fallen in. Meyer said he reported the matter to the Environmental Health Department who arrived promptly and took samples. "They confirmed that that line comes from the Morningside area and so serves the light industrial area of lower Morningside. I have received emails from people who fell ill after swimming in the area and have sent this info to the officials," Meyer said. EThekwini Municipality’s spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said the relevant unit has sent a water sample for testing and will only receive the results in next two days. "The source of the liquid is also being investigated by officials,” he said. If anyone was in the area and has fallen ill, or if anyone has more photos of this, or some idea what this substance is or where it came from, please contact Martin Meyer at ward27@ethekwini.org Daily News
