SA Rugby announced last week that the museum will be closed as a cost-saving measure. SA Rugby chief executive Jurie Roux said it was a “painful decision” but the economic landscape and the running costs have become a challenge for the business. “We have engaged with many stakeholders for many months on avenues by which this course may have been avoided, but ultimately we had no choice,” Roux added. Located at the V&A Waterfront, the museum replaced SA Rugby’s memorabilia site at Newlands in 2013. The museum won regular accolades and earned the Trip Advisors’ Certificate of Excellence award annually. In 2014, it was shortlisted for the International Museum of the Year Award in the UK’s Museum and Heritage Awards. Over the past five years, the museum has attracted over 200 000 visitors who explored more than 20 interactive touch-screen exhibits, 64 audio visual displays, half-a-kilometre of graphic panels, a film presentation in a mini-Springbok cinema and iconic artefacts from rugby history. luke.folb@inl.co.za Weekend Argus
