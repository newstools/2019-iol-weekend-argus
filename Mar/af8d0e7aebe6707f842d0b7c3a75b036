Durban - An animal guardian group has come to the rescue of a starving dog that was found stuck under a driveway gate in Phoenix. Sashni Seepersadh, who created the Animal Guardian group on Facebook, said she was left heartbroken when she received a call of animal abuse from a Tynecroft Place resident on Tuesday. "An investigation is under way to find out why the owner allowed his dog named Ringo to be in such a poor health condition. The dog was on the brink of death when I got there. To my disgust, this is an elite area in Phoenix with neighbours who turned a blind eye to this baby who was desperate for help. I am not afraid to name and shame this demon and I will ensure I get justice for Ringo at any cost," Seepersadh said. Currently, Ringo is at a vet receiving treatment. Seepersadh said the dog was not in good health on Wednesday afternoon. "My heart is in tatters I cannot believe we have demons in our society. There must be justice for Ringo," she said.
