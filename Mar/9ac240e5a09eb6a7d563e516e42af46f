Durban - A six year-old boy is in a critical condition after he fell out from a building window on Dr Pixley KaSeme (West) Street on Friday. Garrith Jamieson, Rescue Care Paramedics spokesperson, said the boy sustained multiple injuries. "It is alleged he fell from the sixth floor of the building. The circumstances around the incident are unknown. The boy was treated on scene before being rushed to a hospital for further care," Jamieson said. Durban Central SAPS are on the scene. A few weeks ago Pietermaritzburg SAPS opened an inquest docket after a boy child plunged 10 storeys to his death from a bathroom window.  The grade 5 pupil who lived in a flat in East Street, had apparently told his mother that he was going to the toilet. She realised he had been gone for a while, and when she had called for him, there was no response. The bathroom door was locked but she managed to break it down. The boy was found dead outside the building. Daily News
