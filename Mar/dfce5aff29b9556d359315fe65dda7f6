DURBAN - A second foetus has been found abandoned in Durban this week. The foetus was found on Saturday evening in Bellair, near the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital. KwaZulu-Natal Emergency Medical Services spokesperson, Robert McKenzie, said paramedics had just finished a case at the hospital when they were directed to the scene near a sports ground. “They sadly declared the abandoned foetus deceased at the scene. The scene was then handed over to the South African Police Service for further investigation,” he said. On Friday, a foetus was found in a storm drain in Reservoir Hills. Rescue Care spokesperson, Garrith Jamieson, said paramedics were called to the scene by members of the public who found the baby abandoned in the drain. Meanwhile, the Newlands East woman who allegedly dumped her baby in a stormwater drain last month is set to appear in court on April 8. The 32-year-old woman was arrested after her newborn baby-girl was discovered by a passer-by inside the drain. Emergency services embarked on successful three-hour rescue operation, and the baby was airlifted from the scene. According to The Mercury, the biological father of the man said he wanted his daughter to live with him. He admitted to having an extramarital affair with the woman. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
