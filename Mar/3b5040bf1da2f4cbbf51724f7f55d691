Cape Town - ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa, Minister of Police Bheki Cele and the ANC Western Cape head of elections Ebrahim Rasool went door-to-door on the election campaign trail in Delft on Friday. Hundreds of men, women and children gathered in the streets to catch a glimpse of the president. He could be seen giving a speech to ANC supporters clad in yellow t-shirts with the president's face on the front and the words “help South Africa grow” on their backs. “Everyone has an appointment with me on the 8th of May!” President Ramaphosa said addressing the crowd. The residents of Delft marched and danced amongst the grey council houses of the area. They were excited that the president had joined them in their homes. However, they voiced their concerns about the crime that seemed to have taken over their homes. They also voiced their frustration about a field just outside of Delft that has allegedly been used by criminals to commit smash-and-grab crimes, rapes and to bury the bodies of murder victims. The 2019 elections will be the fifth democratic election that the party will be campaigning in since the first democratic election in 1994.    Cele and Rasool stated that they would focus on getting rid of the gangs and make the area safe should they win the Western Cape.
