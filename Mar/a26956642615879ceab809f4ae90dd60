Clarissa Venter, 34, must also issue an apology and attend an anger management session. Her attorney, William Booth, told Weekend Argus Venter was “thrilled”with the outcome of the disciplinary process. Western Cape Education Department spokesperson Jessica Shelver told Weekend Argus the disciplinary process had been concluded and the SGB decision ratified. Venter was recorded on video having a verbal altercation with the pupil on February 5. Shelver said the mother of the Grade 9 pupil from Gugulethu had removed her child, 16, from the school before her disciplinary hearing could start. At the time of the alleged assault, the family of the pupil said the girl was experiencing “sleepless nights” due to the trauma she had experienced. Venter and the learner will, however, still square off in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court on April 1 and April 18 in connection with criminal assault counter-charges which they brought against each other.
