Durban - The South African National Roads Agency SOC Limited (SANRAL) has slammed a recent social media post that one of the N3/N2 interchange bridges commonly known as the Spaghetti junction  was damaged SANRAL has noted the posting on social media of a photograph of a bridge with a gap and which is purported to be the Spaghetti Junction (EB Cloete Interchange) on the N2 outside Durban. SANRAL Eastern Region Regional Manager Dumisani Nkabinde said it was rather unfortunate that a social media post has gone viral, claiming that Spaghetti Junction in Durban “is cracking and will be closed”. The post requested the public to “keep away”. “The photo shows a type of expansion joint located in the span of the bridge commonly known as a half joint. It is not a crack in the deck but is designed to expand and shrink. The picture is not from the EB Cloete Interchange located in Durban, but from an interchange in the United States which also appears to be called “Spaghetti Junction”. This is further confirmed by the fact that this type of joint is not used at EB Cloete interchange, and the piers and parapet appear different to those at EB Cloete.” Nkabinde said. The Spaghetti Junction in Durban is in good condition and there is no structural defect. SANRAL continuously evaluates the national road network against a set of norms and standards and applies this analysis during project design, construction and routine road maintenance. Daily News
