Cape Town – Twitter was abuzz on Wednesday night with the words "Did anyone else see that massive streak of light". This was not restricted to Cape Town, but those words – and the after-effects of the streak of light and subsequent explosion – seemed to reverberate all the way to Franschhoek, the Swartland, Overberg, Stellenbosch and Hermanus. This was in response to the sight of it flashing across the sky between 8.10pm and 8.30pm, with the duration varying depending on who was quizzed. It was apparently then followed by the sound of an explosion, which some said sounded like a gas bottle exploding, the citizen.co.za reported, and some even thought it had been a rocket. One person caught evidence of it reflected in his pool on CCTV. The SA National Space Agency later confirmed that a meteorite had plunged to the ground in the Helderberg region, Netwerk24 reported. A resident in the Overberg region said it had felt like a "mini earthquake". "A lot of glass shattered in the house... literally the whole house started rattling after what sounded like a large explosion. People said they could hear it many kilometres away."             Stephen Deck posted: "I know this doesn’t look like much to the naked eye, but what you are looking at is the smoke trail of a flaming meteorite that just fell less than 20km from us. It broke into two pieces…" Leigh Gabriels, whose grandmother lives in Hermanus, tweeted that "houses/windows were shaking. Dogs barking. All neighbours out in the street after explosion."     Weather Today Africa, responding to @JurgSlabbert's tweet, said: "Seems like a meteorite? Unconfirmed. Sightings in Hermanus, Cape Town, Brackenfell and Stellenbosch. Loud bang that shook windows."
