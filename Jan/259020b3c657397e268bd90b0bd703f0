“South Africa definitely has some great talent,” said Bolt. “I’ve noticed over the past couple of years that you guys have really stepped up your sprinting game. It shows when you can make a 4x100m relay team with top athletes.” The Jamaican sprint king arrived in South Africa on Wednesday as he is set to co-host the Sun Met at the Kenilworth Racecourse this afternoon. Bolt is also in the country to launch his champagne line, the “Usain Bolt Cuvée Olympe Rose” . The 32-year-old believes South Africa has a bright future in sprinting. “Over the last few years it’s been very apparent that South Africa has gotten better and better on the track. “The more sprinters you have, the more likely it is that youngsters will be interested in taking up the sport. It’s all about creating role models. “When kids have good role models, they want to follow in their footsteps. South Africa has great role models and so I won’t be surprised to see more great talent coming out of South Africa for years to come.” Saturday Star
