Cape Town – A 29-year-old male from Mitchells Plain tragically drowned at the Wolfgat Nature Reserve on the False Bay coastline close to Khayelitsha after trying to rescue a disabled teenager on Wednesday afternoon. City Law Enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason said in a statement the incident occurred at about 4.30pm. A 13-year-old girl playing in shallow water got into difficulty after being drawn dangerously into deeper water. The 29-year-old male, who has yet to be identified, spotted her predicament and bravely went to her rescue, but unfortunately also struggled to keep his head above water. "Another bystander then also went in and he also got into difficulty. The girl and one of the males managed to make it back to shore, but the 29-year-old male tragically drowned," Dyason said. "Lifeguards who arrived on the scene administered CPR, but it was sadly in vain. The girl and the male have been transported to hospital and are receiving treatment."
