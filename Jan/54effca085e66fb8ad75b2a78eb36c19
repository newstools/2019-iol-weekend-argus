eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede made a bold move when she dumped the controversial Jacob Zuma album which had raised the ire of ratepayers and opposition parties (“City shelves Jacob Zuma record deal”, Daily News, January 23). She said proper protocol was not followed and that she first heard of the hair-brained scheme when she read of it in the newspapers. The city’s head of Parks and Recreation, Thembomkosi Ngcobo, saw nothing wrong using ratepayers’ money to record Zuma’s Struggle songs even though his name features prominently in the Zondo Commission of inquiry. In his latest testimony against Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, Angelo Agrizzi made damning allegations that the former president was also on the pay books of Bosasa. But Ngcobo wanted to give credence to a fallen hero who had wandered far from the path of the founding fathers of the ANC and had brought its name into disrepute and messed up the economy like never before. Thanks, mayor, for whipping Ngcobo into line. You have won the respect and support of the citizens. I hope you do the same with other city officials who abuse public funds. Daily News
