Durban - A Durban couple and two co-accused appeared in the Durban Specialised Commercial Crime on Thursday on allegations of corruption and money laundering amounting to R57 million. David  Brandsma, 55, his wife Beverly Brandsma, 52, Frederick Hume, 45,  and Jeffery Knight, 54, were arrested by members of the Durban Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigating unit following a two-year investigation. According to Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha it is alleged the Brandsmas worked in cahoots with Hume and Knight using three entities – To Be Sales 5 CC, Hume Meats PTY Ltd and Transtrade PTY Ltd – that were contracted as suppliers of frozen goods to Boxer Superstores and laundered almost R57 million over a period six years, from 2011. "David Brandsma was employed by Boxer Superstores store during the said period and aided by his wife, a director of To Be Sales 5 CC sourced the goods from the two other contracted entities at inflated prices and then arranged for kickbacks to be paid into his own bank account. "The disguised kickback arrangement carried on until retailer’s internal auditors picked up the irregularities on one of the transactions." Ramovha said a case of fraud was opened Westville SAPS in August 2017. Pending the investigations the investigating team was able to attain an interim preservation order totalling R20 million. On Thursday the couple were granted R50 000 bail each, while Hume and Knight were released on R75 000 bail. The matter has been postponed to August 26 for a pretrial hearing. Daily News
