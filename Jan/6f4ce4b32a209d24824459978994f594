Ca[e Town - The South African National Roads Agency SOC Limited (SANRAL) would like to inform the public of scheduled and controlled road closure on the R300 towards Paarl (N1), at the Stellenberg Interchange from 25 January until 1 February 2019. Contractors need to commence with the scheduled maintenance of the bridge, which involves raising the bridge decks to replace the bearings on top of the piers and abutments. No bridge traffic loading can be endured during certain of these operations. This will require both full and partial closures as follows: A full road closure will be done at the R300 bridge (towards Paarl N1) on Friday 25 January 2019 from 00h00 until 04h00 only.  A suitable detour will be adequately sign posted. Traffic services will be on-site during the full road closure. Shoulder closure at the R300 bridge (towards Paarl N1) from 05h00 on Friday 25 January until 17h00 on Friday 1 February 2019. “We will endeavour to complete the works and open the road as quickly as possible, and we appeal to the public to be patient during this process.
