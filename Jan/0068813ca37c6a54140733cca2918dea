Cape Town - Academics from the University of Birmingham City in the UK, arrived in Cape Town on Sunday night to help rebuild the community of Wupperthal near Clanwilliam, which experienced a devastating fire last year. In December the town hall, the school’s boarding house and 55 homes were destroyed in the fire. People who lost their homes are now staying with friends and family in Wupperthal. Today, 28 January, the visiting delegation will conduct an initial fact finding mission to define sectors in which the university may assist on an ongoing basis. The academics will look at refurbishing and restoring the 55 homes so that they look the same as they once did. They are from the fields of engineering, architecture, social development, and renewable energies. Later they will focus on the socio-economic development of the region. Fruitful Futures director Matt Stokes, who has been working with the community, said the group of academics will be looking at rebuilding and restoring the quaint historic homes. His organisation has worked with the Moravian Church and the people of Wupperthal over the past two years. “We will also be looking at renewable energy and getting more internet connection for the town… It is a special town with a 200-year-old history with about 1 600 people staying in the valley, and has a zero crime rate,” he said. rusana.philander1@gmail.com Cape Argus
