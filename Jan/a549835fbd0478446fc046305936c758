Kensington Palace on Monday announced that Prince Harry will be in Norway on 14 February, which means that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be spending their first Valentine's day as a married couple apart. Harry will be in Norway's Bardufoss to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Exercise Clockwork operation, which saw helicopters operating in the Arctic Circle for the first time. Meghan, who is pregnant with the couple's first child, recently revealed that she's due in April.

Aides are now spending hours each week combing through accounts on Instagram and Twitter to moderate comments after they discovered hundreds of messages – many of a racist and sexist nature – were being left on their feeds. They are also employing automated tools to weed out the most hostile and offensive comments.
