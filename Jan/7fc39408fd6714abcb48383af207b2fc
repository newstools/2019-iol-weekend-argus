Cape Town - Four good Samaritans have been commended by the NSRI for their work in rescuing four people from drowning at Buffels Bay, Cape Point, on New Year's Day. "At 17h15 NSRI Station 10 Simonstown and CMR (Cape Medical Response) responded to Buffels Bay following reports from TMNP (Table Mountain National Park) rangers of four people, three females and a male, being swept out to sea by rip currents," NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said. "While NSRI and CMR were responding to the scene TMNP rangers reported all four casualties had been rescued from the water by four men who appeared out of nowhere. They ran into the water and swam after the four casualties and rescued all four casualties and handed the four casualties into the care of the TMNP rangers before leaving the scene and it remains unknown who these four good Samaritans are," he said. "The four men had run past an NSRI Pink Rescue Buoy that is stationed on a pole at Buffels Bay not using the buoy to assist in the rescue. "NSRI Simonstown and CMR paramedics treated two females, a 26-year-old and a 35-year-old, for non-fatal drowning symptoms and they were transported to hospital by CMR ambulance in stable conditions. "The remaining male and female were not injured. All four are from Steenberg. "NSRI commends the swift actions of the four unidentified men who rescued the four casualties and who they are and where they came from remains a mystery," Lambinon said. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
