Durban - Despite a post on social media that a Durban winner had yet to collect their Lotto winnings, iThuba Holdings has said the 39-year-old woman had come to stake her claim to the R9.2million win just two days later. Last week, a post emerged on Facebook stating that a resident who had purchased a Lotto Plus 1 ticket at the Checkers store in Newlands had purchased the winning ticket for the draw on June 16, 2018. iThuba Holdings Corporate Public Relations Manager, Naledi Masopha, said the ticket was claimed on June 18, 2018. "It was claimed by a 39-year-old Coloured female who visited our regional office in Umhlanga. She used a manual selection method with a ticket wager of R10.Â  The winner won a total amount of R9,209, 875,60," she said.  She said a second ticket, purchased in Marikana in the North West had still not been claimed. "Should the ticket expire, the unclaimed money will be transferred to the National Lotteries Commission (NLC) to be distributed to charity organisations or courses, through their National Lotteries Distribution Trust Fund," she said.
