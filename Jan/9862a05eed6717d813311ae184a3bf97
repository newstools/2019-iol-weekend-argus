DURBAN - A visit to a beach in Isipingo on New Year's Day turned out to be swearing and free-for-all shoving match seemingly between two groups of beach-goers, which resulted in a case being opened at the local police station. A video of the brawl, which went viral on Facebook on Wednesday, led to a case of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm being investigated by Isipingo SAPS. In the video, which was over four minutes in length, sand was hurled between the groups and some were seen holding what resembled broken bottles as weapons. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said the case was opened at midday on Tuesday. “It is alleged by the complainant that he was with his family when he was attacked by the suspects, while at the Isipingo Beach. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.” A spectator, who recorded the clip, can be heard screaming “watch your children” as the group became more violent. A series of memes have been doing the rounds on social media - mainly poking fun at a woman who hiked up her dress during the incident.  POST
