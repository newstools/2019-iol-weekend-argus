Zubair Esau, 18, and Ebrahim Patel, 3, were buried in separate funerals. Esau’s funeral was held in Brooklyn and the boy’s in Lotus River. The 33-year-old motorcyclist also lost his life. It was believed other passengers in the family’s sedan included Esau’s wife, sister-in-law and her husband and their two children. They were currently busy recovering after being discharged from the hospital. The Zubair funeral service was packed with people, including family and friends. Ghikmah Esau, former Voice of the Cape (VOC) radio presenter and mother of Zubair, was overwhelmed with emotion over the loss of her son. Friends and family supported her as she continued crying. Zubair recently matriculated and had interned at the VOC. The family were devastated over his death. He had also just been married last year. His wife, Rasheeda Sedick, who could not stop crying, was not coping said Zoerina Esau, his only aunt on his father’s side. As the aunt struggled to get the words out, she explained how difficult it was to process her nephew’s death, because Zubair was so young and had such a bright future ahead of him. The VOC has also expressed their condolences to the family. “Zubair displayed great confidence and ambition, with staff members noting his high level of respect, maturity and consistent positivity. “He was known to be an excellent student and matriculated last year, passing with five distinctions. Playwright Najma Mohamed said that Zubair came to VOC in 2017 wanting to volunteer to complete work for life orientation. She immediately picked up on his talent and roped him in to stay longer. “He was always there always early. He would skate from Brooklyn to Salt River and was always there to help everyone. “He was the most amazing actor and hands-on person in the cast,” said Mohammed. Fellow cast member and producer Widaad Petersen also highlighted that “he was always very helpful and wanting to do more than just his role”. argusnews@inl.co.za Cape Argus
