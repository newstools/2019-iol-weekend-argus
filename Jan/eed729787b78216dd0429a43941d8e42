 Happy New Year!ðŸ’• . . 2018 was a great inaugural year for Agape. Launching on Valentineâ€™s Day, the year saw us serve beautiful Agape brides within South Africa and beyond itâ€™s borders. . . We are looking forward to walking even more brides down the isle this year and building a vibrant community of Agape brides. . . Weâ€™re officially open for the year and canâ€™t wait start creating wedding dresses as unique as each of your love stories. . . Thank you for all your support thus far! . .
