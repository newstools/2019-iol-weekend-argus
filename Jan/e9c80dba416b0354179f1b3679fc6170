 Fire on Signal Hill seems to all be out and just smoldering a little on this Monday morning. #capetownfire #SignalHillFire #LionsHeadFire Helicopters and water planes already in the air. Thank you to all the Fire Fighters #CapeTownFire #LionsHeadFire Cape Town is Awesome! pic.twitter.com/eJJf6EMFoc  One would never guess there was such a huge fire on this part of the mountain. Kudos to all the firefighters for their hard work last night & possibly into the wee hours of this morning! Itâ€™s as if we dreamt it all ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³#CapeTownFire #CapeTownFire #firefighters #SignalHillFire pic.twitter.com/H0CijW2yaZ
