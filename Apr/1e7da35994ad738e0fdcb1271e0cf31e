Durban - Several police officers who took part in a march on Monday morning, have been arrested. At this stage, the charges are unclear. Earlier in the day, a group of about 250 police men and women marched from King Dinuzulu Park in Berea to the City Hall to hand over a list of grievances to SAPS management in KwaZulu-Natal. However, when the group arrived at the Durban City Hall they were made to wait for an official to arrive. After a wait of about 45 minutes, the officers then decided to walk to the SAPS KZN headquarters in Bram Fischer Road.     At the SAPS headquarters, they were told that they would be addressed by SAPS KZN commissioner,  Lieutenant Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi.

According to Lee Mchunu of the South African Police Allied Workers Union, they were arrested outside the building where they were waiting for Mkhwanazi. He said they were taken to Mkhwanazi's office without being told what they were being charged for. Officers had been marching due to 'unfair promotions' within the SAPS. The Mercury
