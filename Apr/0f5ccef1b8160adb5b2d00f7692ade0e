Durban - eThekwini's disaster management teams are on high alert following forecasts of heavy showers and strong winds lashing the province on Friday evening According to the South African Weather Services (SAWS), there is an 80% chance of rain showers with a possibility of strong south-westerly winds along the north coast as a cold front moves over SA. "Tonight over KZN coastal areas, especially south of Richards Bay, we expect showers and rain to persist. This could also lead to localised flooding," SAWS forecaster Wiseman Dlamini said. eThekwini City Manager Sipho Nzuza said: “We are not taking any chances. Our disaster management teams are well equipped and ready to respond in every part of the city. We are appealing to all our residents to always heed our warnings. By doing so, we would go a long way in saving lives." Nzuza urged residents in low lying areas to be ultra-cautious as localised flooding is expected. He also asked motorists using the city’s roads tonight to drive safely at all times and reduce speed. The rain is expected to relent in the morning.
