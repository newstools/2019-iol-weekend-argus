Malema the Gucci Revolutionary enjoys the good and expensive life, from his exclusive Breitling watch to his high-end designer clothing. The irony of Bling King Julius is that he’s very critical of elitism, but has abandoned his people in the townships and joined the mostly white elite. His faithful fascist followers are blinded by his hateful rabble-rousing and that of his lieutenants about the poor black child he once was. Your grown-up Malema is a coconut. Viva capitalism, viva VBS Bank, viva EFF, as your commander in chief becomes king of all he surveys and desires. If the EFF working class don’t have cake, let them eat their hard hats and overalls. It’s Champagne and caviar for King Julius. Robin Naidoo Phoenix Daily News
