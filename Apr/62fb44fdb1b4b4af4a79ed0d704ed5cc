CAPE TOWN - A French tourist was mugged, robbed of her backpack and stabbed in the neck on Tuesday morning in the historic Bo-Kaap, formerly known as the Malay Quarter. The incident happened in Chiappini Street, a colourful row of houses, that draws hundreds of tourists on a daily basis. Bo-Kaap resident Tristan Chesselet told the African News Agency (ANA) that he heard a woman screaming help and went to investigate. He said neighbours had already rushed to her assistance where she was lying on the pavement, bleeding from the violent attack. "She was crying, I'm not sure how severe the wound was. Some of our neighbours were already outside. The ambulance and police took 45 minutes to arrive on the scene," Chesselet said. The incident was captured on CCTV footage from the camera of a resident's house. Chesselet's girlfriend, Lucy Martin, said muggings are commonplace. "We have a mugging once a week, several a month. It's mainly tourists being mugged, mostly during the day, during the week." Police could not immediately be reached for comment. African News Agency (ANA)
