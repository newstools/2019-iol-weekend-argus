Cape Town - Employees at the Kenilworth petrol station where an alleged gang boss was shot dead have described how they ran for their lives when the gunmen launched the brazen attack at the weekend. Police have not ruled out the possibility that the incident was gang-related. The employees, whose names are being withheld to protect their identities, said they had never experienced such an incident and ran for cover at the back of the petrol station. “We were scared, and shocked. It was the first time we were in a situation like that,” one person said. Apparently the employee, who had been serving the victim, was inside the convenience store at the time the suspects approached the driver of the BMW and opened fire, as he had apparently asked him to buy a cool drink. “We ran to the back of the building for cover when they were shooting,” another employee said. The suspects were arrested shortly afterwards along Jakes Gerwel Drive in Goodwood, following a high-speed chase and a shootout with police. They appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court on charges of murder, attempted murder, illegal possession of a firearm and illegal possession of ammunition. The youngest suspect had turned 18, six days ago, and the others are 25, 29 and 35. The case was postponed to Monday for bail information. CAPE TIMES
