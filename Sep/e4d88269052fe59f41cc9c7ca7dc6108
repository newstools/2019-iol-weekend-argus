Pretoria - Taxi drivers in Pretoria are warning commuters not to bother trying to go to work or make their way to the city centre on Tuesday. A taxi driver loading up commuters along Thabo Sehume in the City announced: “There are no taxis tomorrow from the early hours of the morning so don’t even try.” “Even those of you who will try using their own cars, I don’t know where you will drive because we will also blocking the roads. We are going to war.” The Pretoria CBD was tense for most of the day and no foreign nationals or South African vendors were seen on the streets. A lonely hairstylist, who braved to stand by Sammy Marks Square, said her foreign colleagues informed them that they were warned not be out in the streets as there would be trouble. The conflict erupted after taxi driver Jabu Baloyi was killed during an apparent confrontation between taxi drivers and alleged drug lords in Pretoria last week. His death sparked the violence and looting of shops. goitsemang.tlhabye@inl.co.za Pretoria News
