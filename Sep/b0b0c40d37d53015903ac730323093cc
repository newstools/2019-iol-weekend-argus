Johannesburg - The fact that the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) has only managed to collect R687.7 million in e-tolls for the 2018/19 financial year compared to the previous year when they were able to collect R1.87 billion again shows that e-tolls are not working and should be scrapped, the DA said on Sunday. "This information was revealed in Sanralâ€™s integrated annual report, which also indicated that the entity raised an impairment of R10.04 billion on its total e-toll trade," DA Gauteng shadow MEC for roads and transport Fred Nel said in a statement. Motorists in Gauteng had refused to pay for e-tolls since it was implemented in 2013. It was high-time that a solution was found to e-tolls in Gauteng, he said. At the end of August, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula was supposed to make an announcement regarding e-tolls, but instead asked for extra time to consult with all stakeholders on the matter. "A month has now passed, and we are still waiting to hear what the solution to e-tolls will be. The DA has been against the implementation of e-tolls as it is an unfair tax burden on our residents who are struggling to make ends meet," Nel said. If no solution was found to e-tolls, then Sanral would see a further decrease in the collection of e-toll debt. e-Tolls should be scrapped sooner rather than later. The DA would continue to put pressure on Gauteng premier David Makhura to lodge an intergovernmental dispute on e-tolls and instead use the fuel levy to replace e-tolls and not bail out state-owned enterprises (SoEs), he said.
