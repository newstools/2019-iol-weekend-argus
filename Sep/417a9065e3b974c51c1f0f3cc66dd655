Cape Town - A huge alpha male baboon beat the security at Groot Constantia Wine Farm in Cape Town to enjoy a free meal on Saturday, August 31. The animal looked almost nonchalant sitting at the outdoor table and took fifteen minutes to finish his meal, while other patrons sat on watching the comedic scene unfold itself. Luckily the diners' meals were replaced after the baboon headed back to the mountain which is a part of the Table Mountain National Park. According to SA People, Groot Constantia has spent around R900,000 on a special fence to keep the baboons out, and have a team to monitor the perimeter. But the security didn’t get in the way of the baboon’s Saturday lunch. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
