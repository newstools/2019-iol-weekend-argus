Johannesburg - A Grade R pupil kidnapped in front of a primary school in Vanderbijlpark has been found, police confirmed on Tuesday morning. Amy-Lee de Jager, 6, was snatched by four balaclava-clad men in front of Kollegepark Primary School as she, her mother and her five-year-old brother were getting out of the car. The suspects allegedly shoved her brother aside and grabbed the little girl before speeding off. A frantic search ensued for the Grade R pupil on Monday, with reports emerging that the kidnappers had demanded a R2m ransom. Police on Tuesday however, confirmed that the six-year-old has been found. "Amy was found this morning and she is undergoing a medical examination at a local hospital.

It is our appeal that this investigation be allowed to take its course," national police spokesperson Vishnu Naidoo told IOL.
