Sho Madjozi has addressed sexual harassment claims made against her manager on Twitter. Taking to her Twitter page on Thursday, the "John Cena" rapper addressed various topics that's she's been the the centre of the last couple of weeks. In the thread, she starts of by raising her grievances including people saying she made since she's light-skinned, that she doesn't deserve to be called a rapper, that she doesn't write her own tweets and that she's protecting a predator.         The tweets that had Twitter users up in arms were where she referred to the victim as a clout chaser and said she spoke to her and they told her that "she wasnâ€™t actually assaulted by him but explains that the experience triggered her because someone had sexually assaulted her in the past".         This led to users of the micro-blogging to commenting on her statements.                 Sho Madjozi ended her tweets by saying that she would "rather use that little power to fight against the real problem, not against someone who is also a victim like I am".     This comes as she finally dropped the official release of her single "John Cena" which has become a certified banger since making its debut at the Colours Studio last month.
