Durban - The man wanted in connection with the brutal death of his wife in Pietermaritzburg almost two weeks ago, has been found dead in a Durban lodge. A source close to the investigation revealed that Roland Pillay's body had been found on Wednesday. He said the body had been found by a member of the lodge's cleaning staff who came in to clean the room just after 10am on Wednesday morning. "Police were alerted and the body was handed over. An inquest has been opened," the source revealed. Pillay had been on the run for almost two weeks after his wife battered and bruised body was found in their home in Ascot Park home.Â It is alleged that her hands were tied above her head with cable ties and that she has suffered injuries to her head. Days later, police found a white VW Polo, believed to have been taken by Pillay, parked in a field in Hilton. The car had suffered engine damage. Earlier on Wednesday, police were hailed for their efforts after they tracked down a 44-year-old man wanted for the murders of his three children as well as his stepdaughter - in Wyebank. The man allegedly killed the three younger children at their home in Marigold Place before going to the school of the older girl. Her body was found in a bushy area near New Germany. He faces four counts of murder and is due in court soon. The Mercury
