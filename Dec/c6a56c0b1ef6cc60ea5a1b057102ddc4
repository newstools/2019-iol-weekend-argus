Durban - To the horror of many South Africans, the power utility, Eskom has warned that load shedding would be implemented country-wide after it had experienced a shortage of capacity due to a number of generating units being out of service. Eskom which has been battling to keep the lights in South Africa since 2008 are in the process of implementing various stages of loadshedding. These can range from stage 1 to stage four. When in the process of implementing stage four Durban residents can expect to be hit twice in one day by power cuts. But the probability of rotational load shedding remains high and while Eskom cannot say when load shedding will be halted they are advising South Africans to check regularly with the media. Stage 1 requires 1000MW, Stage 2 requires 2000MW, Stage 3 requires 3000MW and Stage 4 calls for 4000MW to be rotationally load shed nationally at a given period, the power utility said. To help you get through the power cuts, the Daily News brings you the full load-shedding list for eThekwini. Remember, If you are scheduled for load shedding from 5 pm to 7 pm, but load shedding is announced from 6 pm onward, you will only be without power from 6 pm to 7 pm. And if you are scheduled on a lower stage and a higher stage is declared, your current time slot will not change. Example: If you're scheduled for Stage 2 load shedding from 4 pm to 6.30 pm but Stage 4 is declared at 5 pm, your current slot will be completed and you will not have additional time added to the allocated period. Here is the time load shedding time table:    Daily News
