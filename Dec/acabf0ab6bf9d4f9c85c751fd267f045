This comes after the Cabinet approved the re-establishment of the National Security Council. Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu said the council would be responsible for approving the national security strategy, the country’s national intelligence priorities and national intelligence estimates. “The council will be chaired by the president in his capacity as the commander-in-chief of the armed and security forces,” he said. Council members would include Deputy President David Mabuza and State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo. The re-establishment of the council comes days after Ramaphosa said sabotage contributed to recent load shedding, and 10 months after he announced, in his State of the Nation Address, that it would be reconstituted. Mthembu said through the council, Ramaphosa would have “line of sight be it domestic or internal security matters”. Political Bureau
