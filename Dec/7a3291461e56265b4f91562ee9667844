There has been an uproar after the deaths of Michael Komape, 5, in Limpopo and another child, Lumka Mketwa, 5, in the Eastern Cape, after they fell into pit toilets. There are thousands of pit latrines at schools in mostly rural provinces. In its written response to the standing committee on appropriations recently, the National Treasury said the government wanted to eradicate 3 898 pit latrines at schools. However, intensified efforts have been put in place to deal with the situation. “The Government has allocated a total of R3.4bn to this initiative over the Medium Term Expenditure Framework. The private sector has also pledged more than R25 million. The Department of Basic Education has identified clear time frames and delivery models. “The department is confident that within the next three years they would have eradicated the remaining pit latrines at schools,” the National Treasury said. Last year, President Cyril Ramaphosa launched a project to get rid of pit latrines. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said earlier this year they would be able to replace the 3 898 latrines. She said this was a priority. Politics Bureau
