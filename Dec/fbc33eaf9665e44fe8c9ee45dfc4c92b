Cape Town - "WTF is Stage 6?" This was the common reaction shared by many South Africans on Monday evening when Eskom implemented Stage 6 load shedding for the first time. The extensive power cuts came after Eskom started the day with Stage 2 load shedding, before moving to Stage 4 at around 10am, and ending with the announcement that Stage 6 would kick in at 6pm. "We regret and sincerely apologise that stage 4 loadshedding will move to Stage 6 loadshedding as from 18:00 today, as a result of a shortage of capacity. This follows a technical problem at Medupi Power Station impacting additional generation supply. The heavy rains has caused coal handling and operational problems at several power stations," Eskom said. "Stage 6 requires 6000MW to be rotationally loadshed." Many South Africans took to social media in disbelief that Stage 6 had been implemented, as well as sharing their confusion as many of their apps and only had information on load shedding stages 1-4. In typical fashion, South Africans dealt with their frustrations the only way they knew how - humour:                                                                                                                                 Here is a look at all the load shedding schedules for the country.
