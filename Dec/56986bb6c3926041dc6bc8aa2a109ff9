Pretoria - The Gauteng Acting MEC for Social Development Panyaza Lesufi is in Mamelodi where Ward 28 residents have been badly affected by flooding. He said they would be assisting the affected residents for the next 48 hours. “We have unleashed all our resources, in terms of emergency vehicles, food and blankets,” he said. Lesufi said no casualties were reported, but a lot of people were stuck in their shacks and some at the river banks. More than 700 shacks at an informal settlement in Eerste Fabrieke, Mamelodi, have been swept away. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

EMS spokesperson Charles Mabaso said: “We've got a number of shack dwellers trapped there because of the high levels of water. "A number of them are on rooftops, but we have emergency services and water technicians there," said Mabaso. "Earlier we had reports that two children had been swept away by the water in that area, but it is not yet confirmed."
