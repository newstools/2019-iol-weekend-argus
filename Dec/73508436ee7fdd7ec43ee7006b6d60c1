First, it was Mampintsha’s mystery weight loss that sent shock waves across social media as fans started making speculations about the musician’s mental and health status. Just over a month ago, Mampintsha, whose real name is Mandla Maphumulo shared a video of him dancing to a new track, giving fans a preview of his latest jam, but tweeps seemed more concerned about his drastic weigh loss than his music. On Wednesday, Babes Wodumo's massive weight loss also drove Twitter into a frenzy after a picture of the singer surfaced on social media. In the photograph, the “Wololo” hitmaker, who looks rather slim in denim shorts, is seen with her partner Mampintsha, who’s seated on a couch with a microphone in hand. While some are still in shock over Babes's “weight loss”, others started pointing fingers at Mampintsha, stating that he has "destroyed" her.     Mampintsha destroyed Babes Wodumo, what a shame. Tweeps seem concerned about Babes and Mampintsha's "toxic" relationship, with some comparing the couple to Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston. Below are some of the Twitter reactions:     Mampintsha and Babes Wodumo are the Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston of SA 😢 pic.twitter.com/LL8Jy4fKKH         More like Ike and Tina Turner Babes Wodumo and Mampintsha's relationship is toxic I don't wanna lie.

We have a culture of kicking a dog when it’s down and almost celebrating people’s downfalls. I really pray she has people that love her and will carry her out of this mess - honestly! Many, however, questioned the authenticity of the photograph, with some suggesting that the snap is photoshopped.     So the new Babes Wodumo is standing next to the fresh and fat Mampintsha.
