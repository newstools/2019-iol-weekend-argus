Harare - Zimbabwe's late former leader Robert Mugabe left behind $10 million (R150 million) in the bank and some properties in the capital, but there is no will naming his beneficiaries, a list of his estate published by state-owned newspaper the Herald showed on Tuesday. The extent of Mugabe's riches has for many years been a source of speculation. Zimbabweans assume that Mugabe, who died on September 6, and his family amassed a vast fortune over his 37 years in power, but there are few hard facts about their wealth. Mugabe's daughter Bona Chikowore in October wrote to the Master of High Court seeking to register her father's estate, which included $10 million held in a local bank, four houses, 10 cars, one farm, his rural home and an orchard, the Herald reported.
