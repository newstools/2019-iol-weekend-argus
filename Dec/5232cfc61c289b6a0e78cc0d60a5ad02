In a surprise move using seldom exercised presidential powers, President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday announced a special remission that will see some offenders having their sentences reduced drastically. However, as a way of frowning at the spiraling gender-based violence that has seen children and women becoming victims, Ramaphosa said those jailed for sexual offences and violent crimes, would not qualify for this special process. Making this announcement on Monday in Bergville, KZN Midlands, while addressing the main reconciliation day event for 2019, Ramaphosa said such remissions were not new as former Presidents, Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki once made them.

Among them is jailed Abathembu King, Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo and fees must fall activist Kanya Cekeshe. It must be noted that sentence remission differs from presidential pardons.

This is while a presidential pardon expunges the criminal record of an offender. Political Bureau
