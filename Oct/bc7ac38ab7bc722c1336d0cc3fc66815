Anele Mdoda landed in hot water over the weekend when she said Kelly Rowland doesn't look good without make-up. This all began when Sizwe Dhlomo tweeted: "Kelly Rowland could lowkey be the best looking one in DC." Anele then quote tweeted him in a now deleted tweet and said: "Kelly looks amazing with make-up. Take that make-up off, then it's tickets. I have receipts".     Kelly Rowland could lowkey be the best looking one in DC... Followed by a collage picture of the "Motivation" singer with and without make-up.     pic.twitter.com/YpNIl6h8pO South African tweeps were confused by both the comment and the "receipts" since Kelly looked good in both pictures.     Whatever emotion youâ€™re projecting please put it back into the dark closet. Kelly Rowland is a beautiful woman. Thereâ€™s no need for this.      Both those pictures are pretty thoughðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚  Is this the "receipts"?ðŸ˜•       I have never in all my years heard anyone say Kelly isnâ€™t gorgeous with or without makeup. pic.twitter.com/sw9lo4IdzD Mzansi then started dragging her for her comments and also started insulting her for her looks.

So US Twitter just found Aneleâ€™s tweet pic.twitter.com/8cazSMJPVL Local tweeps also started distancing themselves from Anele's comments as they saw her being dragged.

Phat Joe's topic is "have you ever been criticized by someone below your level"?... He's trolling ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚     Phat Joe is having the time of his life this morning ðŸ˜‚     Phat Joe right now @Radio2000ZA " have ever been criticize by someone below your level" #Anele pic.twitter.com/ikggNgShkZ In case you missed it, Phat Joe and Anele were caught in a public spat after he questioned why she was a judge on Miss SA, to which AneleÂ labelled him a piece of sh*t for his comments. Phat Joe did eventuallyÂ apologise for his comments via a private phone call, but it seems he couldn't miss this opportunityÂ to throw a little shade Anele's way.
