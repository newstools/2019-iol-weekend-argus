Lol. Cool. Hayden DeReal: Did they clean up the mess afterwards? @merushka_mudaly: why are south Africans adopting unnecessary trends😓 Gender reveal parties have become a norm nowadays. Some of the more popular methods parents opt to use are balloons, a pinata and a smoke bomb. IOL Family reported that gender reveal parties had become a hugely popular trend with parents to elaborately announce the gender of their babies. Jenna Karvunidis, a law student and blogger from Chicago wrote about her experience planning such a party online more than 10 years ago. However, since then her feelings have drastically shifted. In a Facebook post on her page called High Gloss and Sauce she recently opened up about being the person behind the viral trend. Karvunidis actually finds Gender Reveals to be ridiculous. “Who cares what gender the baby is? I did at the time because we didn't live in 2019 and didn't know what we know now - that assigning focus on gender at birth leaves out so much of their potential and talents that have nothing to do with what's between their legs.” POST
