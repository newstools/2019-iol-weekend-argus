Zinhle Madela, who says she attended Sunday night's live show, claimed the Qwabe family caused a scene when¬†Virginia was given the boot. She said the Qwabe family wanted to see the votes from the production company and police were allegedly called during the ruckus. Zinhle also claimed it was Sneziey's supporters who cheered Viggy on since her family were no longer there.     #Somizi #IdolsViggy #idolsVirginia #IdolsSneziey I hope y'all will leave @somizi alone now pic.twitter.com/XO9GkWjtW3 During the competition, judge Somizi has been criticised for predicting the Qwabe twins would be eliminated along the way.     The only bullying I see on idols is that of Unathi and Somizi using their status to influence the votes #Somizi how they always pick one favorite and do everything to back them upü§îü§î#IdolSA has one judge and that is Randal.     #Somizi predicted that one of the twins will leave?And one did. Now as voters we question ourselves if whether are our votes taken into consideration or we just lied to and the judges are the ones who have the final say.If judges get the final say why are we still voting?     Lol when somizi was asked who he thinks is going home, he said the twins. Lol how convenient lol he prophesied over them üòÅ#Somizi     Amanga somizi was killing them every week telling them bayabhora telling them bayamemeza #somizi must leave the show not the twins #uyinja usomizi pic.twitter.com/AS3wwIa9RO     No matter how you'll gonna criticize the twins oksalayo they sing better than you #Somizi Mzansi Magic later released a statement and said the alleged bullying was done from fake accounts.
