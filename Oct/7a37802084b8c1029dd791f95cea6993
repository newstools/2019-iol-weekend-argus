Cape Town - It was a moment that the internet dubbed as the clash between David and Goliath when Springbok scrumhalf Faf de Klerk and Wales lock Jake Ball got caught in the moment during the Rugby World Cup semi-final. Many tuned in to support our rugby players, who have now made it into their third Rugby World Cup final after they secured a 19-16 victory over Wales on Sunday.
