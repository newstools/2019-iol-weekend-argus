Cape Town - The investigation of three men accused of murdering Ukrainian hiker Ivan Ivanov is almost complete and now the State awaits DNA evidence. The trio briefly appeared before Magistrate Goolam Bawa in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court on Friday when prosecutor Nicky Konisi gave an update. “All that's needed are DNA reports for a knife, believed to be the murder weapon and for blood on the clothing of the accused,” Konisi said. Only the identity of Sinaye Mposelwa can be revealed and the court ordered that the names of the other two accused be withheld until an identity parade is held. Mposelwa was arrested while fleeing the scene in possession of Ivanov’s backpack and seen walking with blood on his face. The 43-year-old was hiking when he was robbed of his backpack and stabbed to death near the East Fort at popular tourist spot Chapman's Peak on July 27. The first suspect, Mposelwa, 23, was arrested on the day of the incident by neighbourhood watch members. Items believed to belong to Ivanov were allegedly found in his possession. Less than a week later, police followed up on leads and arrested the second suspect, aged 24, at the Hout Bay harbour in the early hours of the morning. The third suspect was arrested later that same day. The trio face charges of murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. Ivanov's body was received in Switzerland by his wife, Tina, back in August. The trio are back in court on December 4. @TheCapeArgus vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
