The number equals approximately four children being murdered in the province every week. According to an analysis of child murders in the province presented by the Department of Social Development, between April 1, 2013 and March 31 last year, more than 781 children between the ages of 13 and 17 were killed, as were 76 between the ages of six and 12 and 128 between the ages of 0 and five. Earlier this year, the Red Cross War Memorial Childrenâ€™s Hospital revealed that over the past 25 years the hospital has seen an increase in the numbers and severity of child abuse and neglect cases at the facility. During the first five months of 2019 alone, over 270 children seen at the hospital have been victims of child abuse, neglect or violence against children From today the public can have their say on the candidates for commissioner who will have the power to monitor, investigate, research, educate, lobby as well as advise and report on matters pertaining to children in the province.
