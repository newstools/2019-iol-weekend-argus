Pastor Paseka David Jika, 46, originally from Lesotho, died after multiple shots were fired at him at the Silver Lakes establishment. According to Boschkop police spokesperson, Constable Yeroboam Mbatsane, the suspects, two armed with pistols and two unarmed, locked Jika, who was with his wife, inside and fired the shots during the early hours of Saturday morning. “The security guards were alerted by a woman screaming at about 4am. Multiple shots were fired but his wife was not injured,” he told the Pretoria News. The suspects were not wearing anything to hide their faces, Mbatsane added. The men took two cellphones and R10 belonging to the couple. Cases of house robbery and murder were being investigated and no one had been arrested by yesterday. The guest house yesterday denied the incident, saying police had incorrect information. “There was no shooting or anything violent here. I was here the whole time and all is in order,” a person speaking on its behalf said. The church could not be reached to confirm the incident. Mbatsane urged members of the public with information to call police on 012 802 8200. Pretoria News
