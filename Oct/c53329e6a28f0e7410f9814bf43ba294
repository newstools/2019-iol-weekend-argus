The SAHRC has confirmed that it has received the Springbok lock’s papers. The commission is studying the bundle of documents to file their replying affidavits. The litigation stems from the commission’s recent announcement that it would institute legal proceedings against Etzebeth in the Equality Court. This after the rugby star was accused of being part of an alleged race-based assault in Langebaan, just days before the Springbok World Cup announcement. Four people alleged Etzebeth and a group of other men assaulted, pistol-whipped and racially abused them early on a Sunday morning. It is also alleged that he called 42-year-old Enver Wilsnach a “hotnot”. According to Wilsnach along with Yoraya Papier, Mogamad Smith and Kay Lee Brook the incident happened outside the Watergat restaurant in Langebaan on August 25. The four have sued Etzebeth for damages in excess of R1 million. The incident has evoked widespread condemnation and was followed by a series of protests in the west coast town. Etzebeth has denied all allegations. In addition to charges of hate speech, the police are also investigating the four people’s allegations. The past weekend the Khoisan Defence Campaign lead by Sammy Claassen handed a memorandum to the police calling for actions be taken by the National Prosecution against Etzebeth.
