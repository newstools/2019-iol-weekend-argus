Cape Town - The ANC’s Integrity Commission, chaired by party veteran George Mashamba, has called on former State Security Minister Bongani Bongo to step aside from all party positions and activities, pending the finalisation of his criminal case. Bongo was arrested by the Hawks in Cape Town and was released on bail of R5000. He is due back in court in January. The charges relate to the alleged bribery of the former evidence leader of the Eskom inquiry in Parliament. Bongo declined to comment on Saturday after the call by the integrity commission. Commission chairperson Mashamba said Bongo should step aside. The ANC’s National Executive Committee must take a lead in this by restoring public confidence in the party, said Mashamba. “The integrity commission recommends that the NEC take swift and decisive action to restore the confidence of the public in the ANC’s stated position of zero tolerance against corruption. To that end comrade Bongo should be instructed to step aside with immediate effect from all positions and activities of the ANC, including his deployment into public office by the organisation until his name has been cleared of the criminal charges levelled against him,” said Mashamba.
