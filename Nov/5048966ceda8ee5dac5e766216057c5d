Cape Town - The internet could not get enough of the lovable, and 'chaotic' Faf de Klerk after pictures and video of him in his speedo went viral all over social media. The images were snapped from within the locker room after the Springboks had defeated EnglandÂ 32-12Â in the Rugby World Cup final. Recently, during the semi-final with Wales, De Klerk was part of a moment that the internet dubbed as a clash between David and Goliath when the Springbok scrumhalf and Wales lock Jake Ball butted heads during. The 1.72m tall De Klerk lived up to his nickname as "Giant Slayer" as he smirked at the 1.97m tall Ball without a hint of fear. However, while his bravado caught everyone's attention last week, it was Saturday's cheeky antics that brought a smile to many on social media.         People were quick to comment on the lovable yet "chaotic" De Klerk and his trunks.     This is how Faf met Prince Harry ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ pic.twitter.com/Jiti93HVsp                                     FAF IS A BAD BITCH                         His speedo is from a local brand calledÂ Bean Bag The Brand, and if you want to be just as cool as Faf, then you can visit themÂ here.
