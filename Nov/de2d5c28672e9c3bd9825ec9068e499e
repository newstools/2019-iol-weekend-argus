Bonang Matheba recently posted a picture of Springbok rugby captain Siya Kolisi with his coveted award in one hand and a neatly boxed up House of BNG bottle in the other. Kolisi who recently led the Springboks to victory in the 2019 Rugby World Cup held in Japan, won the People’s Choice Sports Star of the Year award at the recently held South African Sports Awards held on Sunday in Durban. Sharing a heartfelt message on the social media platform, Matheba wrote: "Dreams DO come true!
