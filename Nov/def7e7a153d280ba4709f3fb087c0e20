Cape Town - Voted as one of the most beautiful women in the country, Miss World South Africa, Sasha-Lee Laurel Olivier hopes to raise over a million rand to get ten thousand packs for her "beauty with a purpose" campaign. She plans to support men and women who have been sexually assaulted regardless of the outcome of the pageant on December 14. “I understand that being Miss World South Africa comes with a big responsibility, and I am just grateful to be here. It’s something I have to remind myself  of every day,” said Olivier. Growing up in Alberton, Gauteng, Olivier always wished to wear the Miss World South Africa sash and it has been her life-long dream. “I had to command my space and stand up and fight for what I believed is mine,” added the beauty queen who said the Miss World would be a great platform to champion her cause. As part of her #ItsNotYourFault campaign, Olivier will be at the Kensington police station on Wednesday to distribute Rape Comfort Packs. “My objective is to break the chains of silence, shame and fear. I have always wondered why society created  an attitude of silence for the vulnerable or those who have survived something so traumatic,”  she said. “We need to get to the place where we have more awareness, we liberate more people and people who aren’t afraid to share their stories,” she added. CEO of Miss South Africa organisation, Stephanie Weil, said that they were delighted to announce that Sasha Lee will represent SA at the Miss World competition and they intend to support her Beauty with a Purpose campaign. “Gender violence is a scourge everywhere in the world, but never more so than here in South Africa where the statistics are alarmingly high,” said Weil. “We know that she will succeed at shining a much needed spotlight on this issue and highlighting the need to act, to put an end to sexual abuse,” she added. If you want to support you can access BackaBuddy online and the rape comfort pack costs R120 each. Weekend Argus
