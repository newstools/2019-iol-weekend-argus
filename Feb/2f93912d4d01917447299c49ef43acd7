The petition on change.org, titled “Sell the Northern Cape to Namibia for R420 Billion to erase Eskom’s debt”, was started by Aiden van Niekerk last week and had by Sunday garnered 83 signatures, with a total goal of 100 signatures. The petition, to Ramaphosa, states “Eskom has too much debt, taxpayers are tired of paying, and nobody lives in the Northern Cape. I don’t know, tell the Namibians it has a desert and a big hole or something” as a motivation. Signatories gave the following reasons for signing the petition: “The Northern Cape is literally the armpit of South Africa,” Andrew Rall stated, while Teria Maritz wrote “yes, we can make it prosperous”. Twitter users were also seen putting their support behind the idea. “I agree. The Northern Cape must be sold to Namibia,” Twitter user Cuddles_@_navybaby stated. “Let’s sell the Northern Cape to Namibia to cover the Eskom f*** up,” I’mLily@Just_Oneil added. “Northern Cape is an unnecessary expense to the government. All their municipalities are broke, Eskom is just giving them free electricity. The whole province is a waste of space GIVE IT TO NAMIBIA and let them be boring together,” Twitter user Bhut’ Themba@_uBhungane said. However, one user questioned weather Namibia would actually want the Northern Cape. “Namibia, let’s actually think about it seriously. Do we WANT the Northern Cape?” Anne Hambuda@MissAnneDastood asked. Diamond Fields Advertiser
