His proper Facebook account is under the name Somizi Buyani, while the fake post was made under the name Somiza’Somgaga Mlongo. The Facebook post features a picture of Somizi with the caption: "I’m Tired of pretending, Trevor Noah is not Funny. (sic)" In response to the diss at The Daily Show host, Trevor’s fans lashed out, defending the US-based comedian. N’shimba Tshitende Rene clapped back at Somizi: "And we are tired of pretending you are not a woman." However, Somizi hit back, saying: "Hello Everyone, Just to make your aware, there’s a fake account on Facebook and Instagram using my name. "I only have one account on Facebook (Somizi Buyani) and Instagram (Somizi), I’ve tried everything to stop them with no success. Please unfollow them or block them."     A post shared by Somizi (@somizi) on Feb 18, 2019 at 8:43pm PST Fortunately, some fans came to his rescue. Masego_ford wrote: "The Facebook account is disgusting and I hope your fans know that it’s fake @somizi . I had to unfollow it." Matselana_modutwane added: "We’ve seen it and we could just tell it’s not you Somgaga. It’s easy to tell when someone is trying to destroy another person’s reputation."
