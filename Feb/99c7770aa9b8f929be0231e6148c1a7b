When she gets home her mother should dish out another one." Evelyn Swarts: "No behaviour on either side was right!" Bulelwa Mrasi: "Our kids are becoming ungovernable serious." Denise Thompson Schmidt: "What is wrong with students. Where is the respect. When we even rolled our eyes at our teachers the girls where hit on the bum with a slipper and the boys got the cane!" Zolani Newu: "Slapping a child at school it's illegal you can say whatever." Fatima Rawoot: "Clearly this started in an undisciplined manner in which the teacher reprimands and provokes further now really now i know all adults r stuck with youth issues but we have to be very cautious on not taking our personal stress levels out on them shes definitely not fit to be an educator from a mom of many."                           ** To comment on this story, write to arglet@inl.co.za.
