Cape Town  A horrific crash on the N2 between Bot River and Caledon has claimed the life of former Springbok fullback Gysie Pienaar’s daughter, the father of another ex-Springbok, Ruan Pienaar. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa confirmed that a woman driving a VW Polo died in the head-on collission on Friday, which involved three other vehicles – two Mercedes trucks and a Hilux bakkie. Messages of condolence started pouring in on social media after the death of mother-of-two Rene O'Ehley, 38, who lived with her financial adviser husband Edmund, 41, in Vredenburg. O'Ehley, who has an 8-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter, was a teacher at Bredasdorp Primary. Theuns Stoffberg, a former Springbok teammate of Gysie Pienaar, 64, told Netwerk24: "We heard about Rene's death from a group of former players who connect on WhatsApp, but don't know what happened. We sympathise with Gysie during these difficult times." Edmund O'hley said he and his children are spending Saturday at De Doorns, where his son is playing cricket. "I think it takes a bit of the hurt away and occupies the thoughts on something else. We are all very sad."
