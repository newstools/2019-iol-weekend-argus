Durban - To the horror of many South Africans, the power utility, Eskom has warned that load-shedding would be implemented country-wide after it had experienced a shortage of capacity due to a number of generating units being out of service. For the first time on Monday, Eskom implemented stage 4 load shedding which meant that some area in Durban were hit twice by power cuts. Stage 4 load-shedding however ended at 10.11pm on  Monday night, Eskom said. But the probability of rotational load shedding remained high on Tuesday with the power utility moving to implement stage 3 load shedding. Stage 1 requires 1000MW, Stage 2 requires 2000MW, Stage 3 requires 3000MW and Stage 4 calls for 4000MW to be rotationally load shed nationally at a given period, the power utility said. To help you get through the power cuts, the Daily News brings you the full load-shedding list for eThekwini. Remember, If you are scheduled for load shedding from 5 pm to 7 pm, but load shedding is announced from 6 pm onward, you will only be without power from 6 pm to 7 pm. And if you are scheduled on a lower stage and a higher stage is declared, your current time slot will not change. Example: If you're scheduled for Stage 2 load shedding from 4 pm to 6.30 pm but Stage 4 is declared at 5 pm, your current slot will be completed and you will not have additional time added to the allocated period. Here is the time load shedding time table:    Daily News
