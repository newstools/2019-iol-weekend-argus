The KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board described it as the greatest shoal on Earth. Every year during the winter months of June and July, sardines swim upstream to the east coast to take advantage of the cooler winds. Greg Thomspon, acting head of operations at the KZN Sharks Board, said there have been reported activity in the Eastern Cape, between the Haven Hotel and Hole in the Wall near Coffee Bay. “It is still very quiet further north with scattered Gannets seen in some areas but it does seem like they are feeding on mixed bait fish. There are a few south westerly winds due in the next week which hopefully could get the sardines moving north,” he said. “At the moment, it does seem like the head of the sardine movement is still a couple weeks away from KZN but anything is possible. We have all been surprised by these fish before.” Tony Outa, a fisherman who goes by the nickname “Sardine King”, said he is expecting a good run again this year. “Last year, we had tons of fish. I had collected about 400 crates of fish in one day. I sold them for about R1000 each, reduced it to R800 and then eventually to R200 because there was so much,” he said. Daily News
