Cape Town - The Independent Electoral Commission in the Western Cape said it was aware of a shortage of ballot papers in Cape Town City Bowl and are looking into the matter. So far several areas in the CBD, which include the Vredehoek area, Kloof and at St Cyprian's School, have run out of ballot papers. At a media briefing earlier IEC provincial head, Courtney Sampson, said they have enough ballot papers. According to Sampson, voters' belief that they could vote at any voting station despite not being registered there has contributed to the shortage of ballot papers, despite the IEC having "enough ballot papers to run the election twice over". Sampson added that the IEC was aware of a number of people who have decided to leave polling stations without casting their vote as a result of the long queues. “We are aware that this has led to frustration. And this is unfortunate,” he said. Sampson said the rain was also has an impact - with people choosing to go to voting stations nearest to them rather than where they were registered. South Africans are voting in the country's sixth general elections since the abolishment of apartheid 25 years ago. Click here for more #Elections2019 stories. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
