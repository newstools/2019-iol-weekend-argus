Cape Town - The State's pathologist in the Agnes Msizi trial said it was difficult to find a cause of death as she only had a head and upper left leg for the post-mortem report. Goodman Nobade, 52, is on trial in the Western Cape High Court for allegedly stabbing his wife, Agnes Msizi, 37, to death, dismembering her body and then dumping her body parts in various locations in Khayelitsha. Nobade, who pleaded not guilty to murder, said he and his wife had an argument on April 20, 2017. Forensic pathologist Dr. Jill Roman said she was unable to establish the cause of death because she only had the head and left upper leg to examine. She said a sharp knife would’ve been required to dismember the body parts. “In my opinion for concealment purposes he dumped the parts so that not all parts can be found making evaluation on cause of death more difficult,” said Roman. According to Nobade, he had woken up early that day. Msizi asked him about his plans for the day. That conversation escalated into an argument. He said Msizi had a knife. He admitted to dismembering her body and then dumping her parts at the TR Section, at some bushes in Baden Powell and in a small river behind the N2. He eventually handed himself over to police after his niece and police went to his home in Khayelitsha in search of Msizi. zodidi.dano@inl.co.za Cape Argus
