Durban - The Phoenix great-grandfather who pleaded guilty to slitting his bedridden's wife throat has escaped jail time. Durban High Court Judge Shyam Gyanda handed down a five-year wholly suspended sentence to convicted killer Nundkumaran Poonusamy Pillay, 64. Pillay pleaded guilty to slitting his common-law wife Dhunalutchmee Naidoo's throat. Naidoo was 69 years old. Her body was found in her Eastbury home on April 8. In his plea statement read out in court by his legal aid attorney, Pragasen Marimuthu, he states that on the day of the murder his wife told him that she did not want to live like how they were living and begged for him to kill her. He said he first tried to suffocate her and when that didn't work took a kitchen knife and stabbed her. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
