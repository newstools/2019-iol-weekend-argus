The poll estimates that the DA currently stands at 50% - we are neck-and-neck with the ANC for control of the Western Cape! We cannot let the ANC/EFF coalition of corruption win! We must unite to keep corruption out of our province, and vote DA on Wednesday. What we do this week could be the difference between a DA-run Western Cape, and an ANC/EFF-led Western Cape. The difference between five more years of progress, and going backwards. So on Wednesday, donâ€™t waste your vote on a small party - they could just hand over their votes to help the ANC/EFF win. Vote for a big, strong party that has beaten the ANC in the Western Cape, Johannesburg, Tshwane and Nelson Mandela Bay before. Vote for the DA so that we can keep standing up for you and your children, and protect your interests. A few single votes could mean the difference between the DA winning or losing the Western Cape, so every vote counts! Please encourage all your friends, family and colleagues to get out and vote on Wednesday.
