Cape Town - In May 2018, the Century City developer invested approximately R40 million in the widening of Bosmansdam Road. The funds came from the development contribution which is used to fund bulk infrastructure projects, as agreed with the City of Cape Town. Since then the road has been turned into a dual carriageway with the construction of two new lanes between Montague Drive and Koeberg Road The City will now also contribute a further R20 million towards the rehabilitation of the existing road and extension of the cycle lane towards the N7 freeway. The work is to commence soon. As for the dualling of Bosmansdam Road, the project has been completed and motorists are already enjoying a smooth driving experience along this section of the road. Some minor works, among which the installation of traffic lights, will be finalised in due course. The project had a two-pronged focus. Firstly, to ease traffic congestion, and secondly, to support the developments taking place within and around Century City. The project took about a year to complete after some minor delays. "This stretch of Bosmansdam Road carries a high volume of traffic to and from Century City and the Edgemead area. Thus, the widening is significantly improving peak-traffic flows for those living and working in the area. Thanks to the upgrade the safety of other road users like pedestrians has also been improved," said the Cityâ€™s Mayoral Committee Member for Transport, Felicity Purchase. "This project epitomises excellence in service delivery as it was designed to meet motorists, cyclists as well as pedestrian needs. During construction the City kept the disruption to traffic flow to the minimum, while cyclists and pedestrians were accommodated via the provision of adequate signage, safe walkways, and access routes. "Motorists now have a better driving experience, while pedestrians and cyclists enjoy a safer riding and walking experience," said Purchase. Cape Argus
