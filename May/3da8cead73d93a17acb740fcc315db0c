Cape Town - GOOD Party leader Patricia de Lille cast her ballot at Pinelands Primary School in Cape Town early on Wednesday as heavy rains hit the Mother City and made for a slow start to voting. "We must never give up hope. There is a lot of things wrong in our country but we have to rise to the occasion to fix it and GOOD has a plan to fix that," De Lille told reporters, who shortly before had outnumbered voters at the polling station. Just a handful of people casted their votes shortly after the polls opened at 7am.    De Lille, the former Democratic Alliance (DA) mayor of Cape Town, was booted out of her position after her relationship with DA leaders soured and she was accused of corruption. In December last year, she started the GOOD party. It is her fourth political home. Analyst predict the messy fallout with her can cost the DA dearly in Wednesday's vote.
