Are impractically tight dresses a thing right now? At the Met Gala Kim Kardashian wore a dress so tight that she couldn’t sit down as her skin-tight silicone dress and waist clinging corset made it impossible! On Sunday night TV presenter and businesswomen Bonang wore a skin-tight floor length gown to the PSL awards ceremony.     💉 #PSLAwards19 📸 @shellingsonsa A post shared by  Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on May 20, 2019 at 2:43am PDT The business mogul hosted the event and had tongues waggling about the cleavage revealing, waist clinching, super tight sequins bedazzled dress with feather detail.     #PSLAwards19 in @villiotifashion 👑♥️🔥 A post shared by  BForce - Bonang Matheba Fans (@the_bforce) on May 19, 2019 at 11:51pm PDT The dress was so tight that Bonang herself had mentioned it in an Instastory.  In the post, the business mogul admits that her dress would pop if she had to sit down.  “This is how I had to sit on my way to the venue because if I don’t my dress is too tight”     #PSLAwards19 @bonang_m is a dream.

Her eye-popping breasts got Twitter buzzing with comments about them. Hinting that she might have had some work on them.     I like Bonang's new boobs they must have cost her a fortune. But she can afford so why not #PSLAwards19 pic.twitter.com/OZuneJTv2s     #PSLAwards19 Is bonang wearing new boobs? pic.twitter.com/p2SfOeFfVk     Bonang didn't have such beautiful boobs when she started tv.
