Cape Town has no shortage of restaurants and might be known for fine dining and high-end wine pairings, but the majority don’t wine and dine, instead they prefer the home-grown flavours of local cuisine. Whether it's fine dining or street food you're after, you don't have to look very far to find a place that satisfies your cravings or budget. It's no wonder that The Golden Dish in Gatesville, Athlone has been voted Cape Town's favourite takeaway spot. In a poll carried out by local cooldrink brand, Jive, Golden Dish came out tops, beating Home of the Whopper, Wembley Roadhouse in Belgravia and Eastern Food Bazaar in the CBD.  With my friend @shaheensydow at his favorite: #GoldenDish #Capetown as we tackle a #gatsby. What's a gatsby? A reason to come here. This one: The Chicken Full House, with egg, cheese, fries, lettuce, peri-peri spice and sauce. (Also had a Masala Steak Full House). I lie down now. #WhatPhilsHaving #NetflixAndPhil A post shared by  Phil Rosenthal (@phil.rosenthal) on Sep 14, 2017 at 8:30am PDT  People could vote for their favourite restaurant or takeaway by using #LetsJiveTogether on social media platforms. Jive spokesperson, Sean Burton says: “While Cape Town is the foodie capital of South Africa, the real flavours have been battling it out on the streets, and we decided it was time these foods were united under one banner. The western Cape's food culture consists of more than just fine dining and fancy food pairings. It’s about the diversity of foods and flavours that represent everyone.” Located on the corners of Hazel and Klipfontein Road in Gatesville, Golden Dish has become a Cape Town institution since it opened in the 1960's. Stop 1/4 of our Jive taxi tour was at New Hope Spaza in Langa. 🚕 This place really has the best vetkoek! I’ve been going there for years and I’ve never been disappointed. Our first unique pairing was vetkoek and mince with @jivecooldrinks_ orange krush flavour. Disclaimer: I still have a few days left before my 30 day vegan challenge officially ends, but today was my cheat day.😛There was no way I could pass an opportunity to enjoy a real Cape Town dite. 🤭 #jivetogether #jivecooldrinks #vetkoek A post shared by  Megan (@meganbaadjies) on Nov 28, 2018 at 7:25am PST You thought the #TsekBurger was BIG. 😱 Introducing the Mighty #YOHBurger weighing in at a whopping 2.8kg....
