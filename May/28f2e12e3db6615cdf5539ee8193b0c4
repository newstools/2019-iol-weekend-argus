Cape Town - Not even persistent drizzle could dampen the spirit of voters in Mamre who turned up in great numbers and shouted in one unified voice that they are tired of waiting for more than 50 years for a high school to be built in the area. The town was found in the 16th century when the governor of the Cape at the time, Willem Adriaan van der Stel, established a military and cattle post in the region. It is also home to South Africa’s fifth oldest church in the remarkable Moravian Mission Station. After casting her vote Elizabeth Oppelt, 65, said: “I’ve been born and raised in Mamre. As a community were are tired of waiting for a High School to be built in the area. Our high school learners are forced to attend school in Atlantis. “Some travel by bus and not all parents can afford the bus fare. It is very dangerous for our children to walk to school in Atlantis and over the years several of our children have been robbed and even still today.” Another concern voter added that the point where High Schools learners are picked up by the bus, is located in a hot-spot where drugs are sold in the area. According to this voter who is a neighbourhood watch member, some of the learners are used as drug mules to take and sell drugs in Atlantis. vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
