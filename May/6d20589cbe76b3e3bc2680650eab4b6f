Cape Town â€“ The illegal abalone trade, often associated with gangsterism and organised crime led to the execution of a search operation last night in Hawston by members of the Anti-Gang Unit. In pursuit of known suspects, ten residential properties and a total of 31 people were searched, which resulted in three suspects, two 39-year-old people and 29-year-old, being detained for questioning in connection with three separate murders perpetrated in the Hermanus area during 2016, 2018 and another earlier this year. The search operation also led to the seizure of R 661 453 cash, 77 cellular telephones, 14 laptops, 20 sim cards, electronic and diving equipment. It is believed that the diving equipment is used for poaching purposes and that the cash was raised through the proceeds of crime. The circumstances surrounding the seizure of the cash and property are currently under investigation. Once charged, the three suspects will make court appearances in Hermanus. Cape Argus
