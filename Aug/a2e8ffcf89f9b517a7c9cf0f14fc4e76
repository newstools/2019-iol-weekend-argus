Cape Town - Three men appeared in the Athlone Magistrate'ss Court on Thursday charged with murdering Philippi woman Meghan Cremer whose body was found early this morning with a rope around her neck. The 30-year-old horse rider went missing on Saturday and her body was found tied with a rope around her neck on Thursday morning at about 1am buried in a sand mine on Philippi farm. The three suspects from Lotus River and Egoli informal settlement - Jeremy Sias, 27, Charles Daniels, 39, and Shiraaz Jaftha, 34 - appeared briefly in court just before midday. They were arrested at about 8pm on Saturday on suspicion of stealing Cremer’s car. Detectives later linked them to the alleged kidnapping and murder of Cremer. They were not asked to plead and no further evidence was led. They are due to appear again on August 15 for a bail hearing. They face additional charges of motor vehicle theft and possession of stolen property. An intensive search was launched after friends and family could not locate her after she was seen leaving her home near Vaderlandsche Rietvlei stables in Philippi. Weekend Argus
