We South Africans must not be fooled by and afraid of the EFF. The only time we should be concerned is the day the EFF takes control of South Africa as the government; then the country is doomed. Malema is a racist and gets away with his bullish, aggressive attitude. He does not serve the interests of the public as a whole in any way and his conduct is unacceptable. Instead, he is fuelling divisiveness among South Africans. This behaviour should not be allowed from a political party, as they should lead by example. Malema contradicts himself at times, saying one thing now and another later, and incites violence at times as well. I sincerely hope that the courts rule in favour of the SA National Editorsâ€™ Forum, which has taken the EFF to the Equality Court over the intimidation of journalists.
