The chaos comes a day after traffic came to a standstill in the CBD when taxi drivers blocked intersections with metro buses. Tshwane metro police department spokesperson senior superintendent Isaac Mahamba said their members managed to clear the road and remove the buses to relieve traffic. Motorists on Tuesday had to find alternative routes to navigate through the heart of the nation's capital. Alternative routes meant motorists driving the wrong way down one-way streets, illegal U-turning and using any space they could find in order to get out of the city centre as quickly as possible.
