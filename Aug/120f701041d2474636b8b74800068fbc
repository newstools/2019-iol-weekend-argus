Cape Town – The search continues for a Melkbosstrand woman, Chantal Retief, who left home 10 days ago. Two other women also went missing last week – Claire Rae Wippenaar, who turned 43 on August 6, and 22-year-old UCT student Eemaan Rahbeeni, from Surrey Estate, who went missing on August 5. The 37-year-old Retief was last seen by her mother in Flamingo Street in Melkbosstrand on August 2. She was driving a silver Opel Corsa, number plate CA 269503. "We think she ran away, like she has in the past, but it's never been for so long," said Retief's brother, Robert du Preez, Die Burger reported. It's suspected the unemployed Du Preez had another setback after undergoing treatment for an alcohol problem. Du Preez, who has a 6-year-old son and left home in her silver Opel Corsa, said the Saratoga Spur in Parow had contacted them last Tuesday after she was unable to pay for her meal, but she disappeared before they could get there. The mentally challenged Wippenaar was last seen by her father at 4pm on August 6. She is driving a Black Opel Corsa Lite, number plate CF 108 582. Rahbeeni was last seen by her mother in Sirius Road in Surrey Estate at 6.10am on August 5.
