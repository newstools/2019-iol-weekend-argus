Recently, South African Gqom artist Babes Wodumo was lashed by the public on social media after she posted a video making fun of Lady Zamar’s acne. Wodumo could be heard mocking Lady Zamar while zooming in to show the acne on her face. Twitter users didn’t find her comments funny. An Elsies River High School pupil was on Monday reported to have tried to kill herself after allegedly being bullied at school and told she was “ugly”. The Grade 9 girl was hospitalised after taking an undisclosed number of tablets last Monday afternoon “to escape the pain”. Provincial education department spokesperson Bronagh Hammond was reported to have said the case was reported to the district office and a psychologist had been informed. Ilitha Labantu spokesperson Siyabulela Monakali said: “Woman-on-woman oppression is not a good thing at all. We expect women to have each other’s backs, especially in a society where women are vulnerable. "Cyber bullying takes emotional tolls.
