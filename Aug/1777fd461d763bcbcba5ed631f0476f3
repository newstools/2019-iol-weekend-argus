Local entertainer Zodwa Wabantu is demanding her lobola back following the announcement that she called off the wedding. The vosho queen broke all societal norms when she paid lobola to her fianc√© Ntobeko Linda‚Äôs family just weeks after she popped the question. Speaking to¬†DRUM,¬†the 33-year-old racy dancer confirmed that the wedding which was meant to take place last Saturday is officially off and is determined to get at least half the lobola money. "It‚Äôs not about me taking a break, the wedding is off," she told the publication. She continued: "We will have to split the lobola money in half. It‚Äôs only fair" The star also made revelations that she will be wearing her wedding dress on the last episode of her reality show "Zodwa Wabantu: Uncensored". The couple took a break from their relationship in June. "I‚Äôm losing myself. I need my spark back. I‚Äôm not happy anymore,‚Äù she wrote on Instagram at the time. Previous reports suggested that the star hinted that her rise to fame may have been a factor in the breakup with her 24-year old beau. Amid the break up, it seems the reality TV star is living her best life. On Thursday, Zodwa posted a video on Instagram of herself and two friends, wearing bikinis, fooling around at Sun Coast beach. She simply captioned the post: "I love all my Problems"     I love all my Problemsü§ù‚ù§Ô∏è A post shared by  zodwalibram (@zodwalibram) on Aug 1, 2019 at 3:12am PDT
