Cape Town – A 24-year-old man is due to appear in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court today after the chopped-up body of a woman was found at a Bellville apartment building. Police said they had "found black bags containing the body of the deceased cut into pieces in another flat" on Thursday. The cause of her death is still unknown. The accused, Kyle Ruiters, a former Wynberg Boys' High School pupil, lived on the 9th floor of the Seesig apartment building in Loevenstein with his aunt, who is an advocate. Body parts of the deceased, Lynette Volschenk, 32, who worked as a draughtsman for an engineering firm and lived on the 10th floor, were found in black and plastic bags in her apartment as well as that of the accused, Die Burger reported, according to sources. It is also alleged that her sawn-off head was found in bushes outside the apartment building and that the accused was found painting walls in her flat after the incident. Jamie Pike started a petition, which has been signed by more than 9 000 people and will be presented at the Bellville Magistrate's Court, for the "accused of the gruesome murder of our dear friend and colleague Lynette Volschenk" to be denied bail.
