PRETORIA - The North Gauteng High Court has ruled that President Cyril Ramaphosa has complied with Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane's remedial action made against the Minister of Public Enterprise Pravin Gordhan by deferring disciplinary action pending judicial review. The judge said it was "mind-boggling" that Mkhwebane would not consent to Ramaphosa's request to suspend the remedial action against Gordhan as similar cases had recently been heard and interdicts were approved. The court battle between the president and the public protector was heard last week on an urgent basis. Gordhanâ€™s lawyer Advocate Michelle Le Roux argued similarly to Ramaphosa and said there was little the president could do to discipline Gordhan while the minister was legally challenging the report.
