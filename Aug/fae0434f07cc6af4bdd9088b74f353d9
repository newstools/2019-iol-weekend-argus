Durban - Zandile Gumede, the embattled mayor of eThekwini Municipality has withdrawn her forced resignation as mayor of the city which led to the cancellation of Thursday's full committee meeting that was meant to swear in the city's new executive. Gumede, along with the rest of the eThekwini executive committee was forced to hand in their resignations on Monday after the provincial ANC gave them their marching orders over poor governance issues in the city. However, just a day before newly-appointed executive was meant to be sworn into the council, Gumede withdrew her resignation setting up a political showdown with her ANC bosses similar to the showdown Patricia De Lille had with DA in Cape-Town who forced her out of office. The ANC in KZN confirmed Gumede's resignation in a WhatsApp message to journalists on Thursday. "The African National Congress (ANC) in Kwazulu-natal would like to confirm that eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede has withdrawn her resignation letter. The ANC Provincial Working Committee will reflect on this matter and the outcome would be communicated accordingly," the message read. KZN MEC for Transport, Mxolisi Kaunda was meant to be sworn in as mayor of eThekwini on Thursday with former Finance MEC, Belinda Scott taking up the deputy mayor role. Councillors in the eThekwini Municipality received a message yesterday informing them that the full council meeting had been postponed. The messages gave no explanation as to why the meeting was postponed. Daily News
