They have given the Queen hit #BohemianRhapsody - the greatest song of all time - their very own unique choral interpretation."

The production team, the band, the video editing. This is international. Well done!! Kobus De Kat Dippenaar: Who is the person responsible for this? I don't think people know how good this is, top to bottom, production arrangement and recording all the way to the video... This is amazing. Congratulations... please let me know, who is in charge here?? Bobby Jo Looms: That was fantastic! I would love to see the female singer sing a Cranberries song. She has a unique voice! Sharon Hendry: Absolutely stunning. My favourite song ever and you guys have done it justice. Cape Argus
