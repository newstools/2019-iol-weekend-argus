Cape Town - The next cold front is expected to set in by noon on Saturday, but it will only be a relatively weak one rushing through the Western Cape, the South African Weather Service (SAWS) said. "We just expect some light rain with this cold front and that will persist for Saturday afternoon into the evening until Sunday," said SAWS forecaster Henning Grobler. It will be overcast by around 11am on Saturday, with the first showers coming in from the west. It should start raining harder from around lunchtime, with the water catchment areas welcoming more rain. "It will have left our region already by Sunday mid-morning. There are no warnings or anything with this cold front â€“ it's just a weak cold front rushing through. "Temperatures should be fairly on the coolish side tomorrow, with a maximum of 15 degrees in the Mother City. "A north-westerly wind tomorrow will start at 15 to 20km/h, picking up in the afternoon up to 35km/h. "There will be another very weak cold front system approaching by Monday evening to Tuesday morning, but probably dissipate quickly. It will mainly be partly cloudy with a light drizzle." Cape Times
