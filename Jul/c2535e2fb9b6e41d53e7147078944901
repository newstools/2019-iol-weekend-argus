Durban - The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) on Thursday thanked Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema for encouraging red berets who were opposed to violence to join the ACDP. "We will welcome those who have come to realise that there is a place in South Africa for all, irrespective of colour or class. We will welcome those who have come to their senses in understanding that the violent revolutionary tirades have no place in building a South Africa that is prosperous, peaceful, free of crime and corruption. The ACDP thanks the EFF leader for pointing such members to our party," said ACDP deputy president and MP, Wayne Thring. Thring made the comments in response to Malema saying at a recent press briefing: "Our constitution says we can use any means possible to take over the country, even the use of arms and violence. If any of our members don’t like it, go and join the ACDP.” Thring said the ACDP would welcome fighters (as EFF members call themselves) who wanted to "build and not destroy", were peace makers, and wanted to advance the cause of millions of South African citizens living in poverty. "Let it be known that the ACDP is indeed a party of peace, not violence. We are a party that seeks to grow our economy, not destroy it. We are a party that sees beyond colour and racial classification, beyond the stereotypes perpetuated by apartheid, which sadly continue today. "These stereotypes continue to define South Africans by racial categorisations, coined by apartheid legislators, and are used by 'radical revolutionaries' to tear the social fabric of our nation, creating social and racial division, rather than cohesion," said Thring. He said the ACDP would welcome EFF members who were "truthful, capable, hate dishonest gain and who fear God". African News Agency (ANA)
