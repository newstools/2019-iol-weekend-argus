District Six Working Committee chairperson Shahied Ajam said: “We are patiently waiting for the Land Claim Court to make that ruling in terms of our initial application which was an order for a structural interdict and declaratory order. And we are confident that the court will make a decision very soon.” According to Ajam, a decision should be made within the next month. “We are even more confident that the District Six saga that has been ongoing for the last 20 years will in fact come to fruition, and that urban restitution will change forever and that the people of District Six will serve as a catalyst on how restorative justice should be implemented,” Ajam said The former minister of Rural Development and Land Reform, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, was ordered by the court to submit a detailed plan for the development of District Six back in May. Instead she submitted papers saying she would not be able to do so before August. Nkoana-Mashabane said a final “holistic plan” was subject to discussions. @MarvinCharles marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
