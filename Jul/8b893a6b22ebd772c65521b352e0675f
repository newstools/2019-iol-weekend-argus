 Letâ€™s all support the brilliant Michael de Adder who was just let go by every newspaper in New Brunswick (all Irving-owned) over this cartoon.@deAdder pic.twitter.com/P9Wua1GcHi   Does it matter if I was fired over one Donald Trump cartoon when every Donald Trump cartoon I submitted in the past year was axed?   It got to the point where I didn't submit any Donald Trump cartoons for fear that I might be fired.   And Donald Trump doesn't even matter. It's a distraction from the big picture.
