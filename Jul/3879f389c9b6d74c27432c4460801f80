Zodwa Wabantu is clearly earning lots of cash from her many jobs and has spoilt herself with a new car. The dancer and socialite took to Instagram to share the news with her followers. In the post, she said: "I used my Brains, my Legs & Lots lots of Respect in the Industry".  She posed on top of the car while a crowd gathered outside the dealership to take pictures and videos of her.
