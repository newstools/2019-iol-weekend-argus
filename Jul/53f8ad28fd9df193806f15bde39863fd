Cape Town - The City’s Traffic Service arrested a driving instructor for drunk driving on Wednesday night. A traffic officer, on his way home, was approached by a member of the public at an intersection along Vasco Boulevard, who indicated that something appeared amiss with the driver of a Toyota Atos, said City traffic spokesperson Maxine Bezuidenhout. "At the light change, the vehicle drove off and nearly hit the kerb. The traffic officer activated his lights and sirens to bring the vehicle to a stop. "The driver, who was unable to produce a driving license, appeared heavily intoxicated and unable to stand unassisted," Bezuidenhout said. "His breathalyzer reading was more than four times the legal limit." The instructor was taken to Shadow Centre in Athlone for blood to be drawn and detained at Goodwood SAPS. In unrelated incident, a truck driver complained to Metro Police officers at a vehicle checkpoint in Gugulethu on Tuesday that two suspects cut the tarp on his vehicle and fled with four tins of paint. Officers spotted the suspects running away, and then gave chase. They recovered three of the four paint tins. The duo, aged 32, was arrested for malicious damage to property and theft out of motor vehicle. Cape Argus
