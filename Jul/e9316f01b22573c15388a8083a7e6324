The body of Devashnee Doorasamy was found in her flat in 9th Avenue on Friday. A case of murder was registered at the Berea police station. Less than a week later, police arrested a 29-year-old man who is believed to be known to the woman. Doorasamy was somewhat of a local celebrity after she got married on a reality show in 2017.
