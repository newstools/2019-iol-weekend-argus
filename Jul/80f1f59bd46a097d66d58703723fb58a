Pretoria - Traffic in the city centre of Pretoria is gridlocked this morning with municipal buses blocking all the major intersections into the CBD. The blockade is part of a widespread municipal workers protest over pay and outsourcing of services. They have threatened to bring the city to a standstill and have achieved that with taxis and cars trying in desperation to find alternatives to the blocked roads - including riding on the pavement and going the wrong way up one-ways - or abandoning their cars on the side of the road and walked.  Frustrated bus passengers at the BRT bus station near Church Square are concerned they would be late for work and school as the bus service is suspended today. A metro officer standing watch near a bus in Madiba Street said they were observing as technically they are not allowed to strike but he said they supported the strike and the mayor should take note.
