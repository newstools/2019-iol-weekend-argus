Cape Town - After 10 months of construction, the new and improved Masiphumelele Taxi Rank will be unveiled in Hout Bay on Friday morning. Mayco member for Transport, Felicity Purchase, said the project cost R65 million and accommodates for 65 legal taxis to operate from the new rank. She is confident that the facility will provide improved services for the 4 000 commuters who use the rank on a daily basis. “We are very pleased that the commuters will be protected from the elements. They will now have toilets and other conveniences that they didn’t have before,” said Purchase. The new facility also boasts solar panels which will help with electricity usage and is completely “green”. Purchase said the storm water system at the rank has also been upgraded and this will go a long way to  prevent flooding in the area especially during the winter months. The construction of the rank created 942 000 temporary employment opportunities for the surrounding communities. Good news for the 30 informal traders at the rank is that they too will now be able to conduct their business in safer and drier conditions. Purchase added that law enforcement officers will continue to monitor the rank to prevent any illegal taxis from operating there. She added that tomorrow’s planned strike by Prasa workers will not affect operations at the Masiphumelele rank. Weekend Argus
