Cape Town - Cape law enforcement officers were left bemused on Monday, after they helped a woman chase down a man who had robbed her, only for them to discover that the man had stolen her dagga. "Law Enforcement officers attached to the Anti Land Invasion Reaction Unit responded to a complaint of members of the public being robbed on Delft Main Road and Olifant Street Delft," said Law Enforcement Inspector, Wayne Dyason. "On arrival in Olifant street, the officers observed a male being chased by a female. The officers joined the chase and apprehended him. He was in possession of a white bag which the officers assumed was the property of the female who chased after him. "The officers opened the bag and found 10x parcels of dagga in the bag," Dyason said. "The bemused officers turned to the suspect who said he robbed the female of the bag and was unaware of its content." Dyason added that the law enforcement officers subsequently arrested both parties and detained them at Delft SAPS. Cape Argus
