Cape Town - A member of the Law Enforcement Neighborhood Safety Team was struck by a bullet in his right foot while on patrol in Philippi East on Tuesday evening. "At about 17:15 members of the Law Enforcement Neighborhood Safety Team (NST) were driving down Symphony Way in Philippi East when they came across two groups of people standing on opposite sides of the road," said Law Enforcement Inspector, Wayne Dyason. "Suddenly the groups opened fire on each other. The officers approached the scene and one suspect shot at the approaching Law Enforcement vehicle. The trajectory of the bullet took it on a path where it entered the front of vehicle, underneath the headlight, entered the footwell and struck the driver in the right foot," Dyason explained. He said that the groups then fled the scene. The officer was hospitalized with the bullet still embedded in his foot, and he is scheduled to have it removed on Wednesday afternoon. No arrests have been made. Cape Argus
