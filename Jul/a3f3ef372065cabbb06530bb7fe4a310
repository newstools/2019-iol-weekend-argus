Durban -The son of a Durban nurse who has been missing since March found himself on the wrong side of the law when he was arrested and charged with fraud. Deveshan Govender, 27, is the son of missing Durban nurse Sushie Govender who was last seen on Isipingo beach. This week KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that police where still searching for the 50-year-old Chatsworth wife and mother. Deveshan allegedly purported to be a financial broker and allegedly defrauded his relatives of R410 000. It is alleged that the money was paid into his account and he had promised his aunt and uncle that he would invest the money for them. He appeared in the Durban Magistrates's Court and was released on R2000 bail. His case was adjourned to August 20. Three weeks following her disappearance dive operator Walter Bernadis spoke about possible drowning. 'If a weighted buoy or dye had been put into the sea within a few hours of disappearance, a body could be tracked. Our coastline is so dynamic with conditions changing from day to day, which makes it extremely difficult to predict." Zwane confirmed that the case was still on-going and appealed to anyone with information on her whereabouts to contact Chatsworth police on 031 451 4267 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111. POST
