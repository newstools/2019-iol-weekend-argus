Cape Town -Â The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) confirmed that Metrorail, the commuter rail operator, will run a limited service during the planned mass action taking place on Friday, 26 July. Because the majority of Safety Critical staff may be participating in this mass action, Metrorail will operate a reduced service, similar to that offered on Saturdays and Sundays. PRASA spokesperson Nana Zenani said the organisation maintains that those employees who decide not to join the mass action have not been intimidated in any way by management but have taken the decision to work independently. "PRASA recognises that the mass action on 26 July is not a labour strike against PRASA but a FEDUSA led mass action against government along with its affiliated union UNTU as the majority union at PRASA. "This means that while UNTU members are granted permission to participate in the mass action, not all PRASA employees within operations will be participating," Zenani said. PRASA added that they would like to caution passengers to expect longer waiting times due to the limited service in line with the weekend-like scheduling. Cape Argus
