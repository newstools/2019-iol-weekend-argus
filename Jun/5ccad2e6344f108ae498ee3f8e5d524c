The summit, to be held at the Lookout at the V&A Waterfront, comes as the global medical cannabis market continues to expand and increasing numbers of countries around the globe legalise its use. With estimates that the cannabis and associated products market could be worth R27 billion by 2023, this potential has led to a boom in regional cannabis interest and investment. “The global interest in Africa’s cannabis market and South Africa’s recent legislative acceptance of cannabis makes Cape Town the perfect destination,” said Saul Kaye, founder and chief executive of iCAN:Israel-Cannabis. CannaTech Cape Town will bring together industry leaders across the world. These leaders have contributed to the global medical and recreational cannabis market in all fields, including agricultural tech and innovation, business and finance, policy and regulation, science and medicine. “We are thrilled to bring some of the world’s leading companies and investors to Cape Town. They will meet with their counterparts to discuss a range of business and technological issues and work with like-minded professionals, who understand the immense global health and business potential of medical and recreational cannabis moving forward,” Kaye said.
