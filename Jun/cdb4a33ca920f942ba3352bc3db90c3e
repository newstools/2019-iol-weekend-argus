Cape Town - Metrorail Western Cape has apologised unreservedly to its customers for trains coming to a halt across the region on Thursday morning. The delays were attributed to two incidents, said Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott. "In the first instance, a small group of employees elected to disregard PRASA procedure to raise their concerns. Our regional management addressed the issues, and the employees resumed work shortly thereafter," Scott said. "We acknowledge that employees had every right to raise issues of concern, but doing so nonprocedurally impacted unnecessary and unfairly on commuters. We will deal with the matter through our own internal processes and expect that the situation will correct itself throughout the course of the day." Scott said that the second instance had to do with a passenger-related incident. "The Northern line train service was affected by a pedestrian fatality at Elsies River station. We had to redirect trains on to the alternative line which resulted in platform changes between Woltemade and Tygerberg," Scott said. Scott said emergency services responded to the scene, and it is expected to reopen as soon as police conclude their on-scene investigation, and that commuters can expect a normal afternoon peak.
