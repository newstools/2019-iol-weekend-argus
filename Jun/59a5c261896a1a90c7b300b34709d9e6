Cape Town - Western Cape Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz has shared his concern and sympathy for the six Anti-Gang Unit (AGU) officers who were attacked in Samora Machel on Wednesday morning. AGU members were shot and injured as they were tracing suspects in Samora Machel, said police spokesperson Novela Potelwa. They were on a tracing operation in Sweet Home Farm informal settlement and had just apprehended one suspect allegedly linked to recent murders in Samora Machel. "As the members were searching for another suspect also sought for serious crime in the area, shots came from one of the shacks," said Potelwa. Fritz added: "I wish to extend my sincere gratitude to our Anti-Gang, all other SAPS units as well as our municipal police who serve with total commitment and bravery under the most trying conditions. "At the same time I condemn in the strongest possible terms this attack by nameless individuals who are intent on trying to create conditions where their criminality and murderous activities become the norm. We shall not allow this to happen. "Our support for the entire Provincial Police, from the provincial commissioner to the officers who patrol the streets in noble and sincere efforts to create safer communities is unconditional. We stand with them. "I wish a speedy recovery to the brave Anti-Gang Unit members and pledge my support in their efforts towards making our communities safer." Police said that they have launched a manhunt for the suspects. Cape Argus
