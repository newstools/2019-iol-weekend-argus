Johannesburg - A FlySafair passenger en route to Cape Town died just after boarding his flight at OR Tambo International Airport on Tuesday morning. According to the airline's Head of Sales and Distribution Kirby Gordon, the man - whose age they could not reveal - did not look well when he boarded the flight. That, he said, prompted one of the crew members to ask him if he was fine to fly. "He was boarding and at the door when the flight attendant asked him if he was okay. She sat him down on a chair not far from the door and turned to go and consult with the captain so that he could determine if the passenger was fine to fly. "She had just taken two steps when he collapsed." Gordon said as flight attendants are trained in safety procedures and also operate at the level of first responders, they immediately tried to resuscitate the man. "They were unfortunately unable to save his life. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those connected to him and with those who witnessed this tragic event. We would also like to say thank you to the other passengers for their patience," Kirby said. Other passengers were asked to disembark the aircraft so that police could investigate the scene.They were then put on another plane. The latest incident comes after a FlySafair flight from Durban to Johannesburg had to be delayed following the discovery of an abandoned dead foetus in a toilet last week. The Star
