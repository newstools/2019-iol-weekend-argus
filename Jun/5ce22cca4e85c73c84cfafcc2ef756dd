Informal farmers in the Southern Cape have had their hands full since the start of initiation season a week ago, as goats and sheep are in high demand to practise the rite-of-passage ceremony. The small-scale farmers say this period is profitable as many families buy livestock to perform traditional rituals to prepare the Xhosa boys. In George, informal livestock farmer Dennis Langeveld said June and December were the busiest and most lucrative months for small urban farmers. The 54-year-old father of three said he has sold more than 50 goats this month. “All the profits will help me better my family’s welfare,” he said. “The season is beneficial because people buy cash, there are no lay-byes or credit. Families come and buy three goats and sheep per day, which are slaughtered to perform traditional rituals before and during the process of initiation.” Another small-scale farmer, Melvin Dongatha, said: “In the past people used to go buy (livestock) from big and established farmers but now they support us. “We are happy with the support we receive and this makes us to realise the importance of livestock farming,” Dongatha said. He added that unemployed people in the area are able to earn some cash from helping farmers with the transport of the goats and sheep for customers who do not have transport. Weekend Argus
