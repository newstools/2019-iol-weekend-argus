“With this particular Finance Linked Individual Subsidy Programme (Flisp) housing project in the Conifers, there have been many challenges with the contractors and subcontractors which had, in fact, resulted in the stoppage. “We’re fixing any issues or disputes with the contractors or subcontractors,” said Muneera Allie, provincial Human Settlements spokesperson. She said they were still in the process of mediating with the contractors and subcontractors. After residents of the Conifers Concerned Ratepayers Association complained to the National Home Builders Registration Council (NHBRC), they confirmed that they found the construction of the homes to be non-compliant. “Before anything gets signed off for any of our projects, everything must be approved by the NHBRC. The NHBRC does not put a stop to any projects. Like any construction or building or development, there will be some snags that must be sorted out. We have to make sure it is safe for occupation,” Allie said. She said they were looking into some problems with the residents and the main contractor. In April, The Cape Argus reported that Conifers residents were fuming over the infill housing development, which they said was riddled with construction errors. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
