“We can confirm that our investigation has been completed; we have submitted to our national inspector who will decide on whether prosecution will take place or not,” said David Esau, Western Cape provincial inspector. Esau said he was unable to say when the report would be released. RDM is a joint venture between Germany's Rheinmetall Defence and South Africa's state-owned arms manufacturer Denel. It supplies selected munitions and explosives products to armed and police forces in South Africa and around the world. According to the company, the leading cause of a mass explosion that killed eight people at the factory was an ignition propellant. Rheinmetall Denel Munition chief executive Norbert Schulze said: “We are still awaiting the outcome of the investigations by the Department of Labour and the SAPS. Rheinmetall Denel Munition’s own investigation (with external support) to identify the root cause is also still ongoing. We will share all information about all findings as soon as the final results are available.” On Friday Schulze was joined by the German Consul Roland Seidler, Deputy Minister of Public Enterprises Phumulo Masualle, chief executive of Denel SOC Danie du Toit and children from the community at a sod-turning event for a new daycare centre the company is building in Macassar. “We have asked the very children who will make use of this daycare centre to help us build it today, because they are symbolic of how we can build this country; starting from very young and always working together,” Schulze said. The total cost of the building is R10million, which RDM is donating, along with the land (which belongs to Denel) for the daycare centre. The daycare centre will accommodate 150 children, from infants to Grade R pupils. Masualle said: “We need to prepare our children earlier and this partnership can make that a reality.” marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
