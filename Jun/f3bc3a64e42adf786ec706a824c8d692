Cape Town - Two of the six attacked Anti-Gang Unit members are in a critical condition and four others are receiving medical attention. SAPS Management has issued a 72-hour activation plan and wished a speedy recovery to the six AGU members. Police Minister Bheki Cele will on Wednesday, visit hospitalised AGU member and the crime scene. Cele condemned in the strongest possible terms the shooting and attack of the AGU members in the Samora Machel precinct in the early hours of Wednesday morning while on a tracing operation of suspects. Cele' spokesperson Reneilwe Serero said AGU members had just apprehended one suspect, who led them to another suspect sought for serious crime, when shots came from one of the shacks in the Sweet Home Farm informal settlement. "The area is difficult to access with a terrain that is poorly lit and shacks are erected close to each other". Cele said: “Attacking members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) is an attack on the state, safety of our men and women in blue remains high on the agenda of the SAPS and is at the heart of the SAPS’s strategic imperatives to ensure the safety of our members". sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
