Cape Town -Â A cold front is expected to make landfall over the south-western parts on Thursday night. The SA Weather Service forecasts winds of between 65 and 80km/h from Thursday afternoon, with a potential of winds reaching 85km/h, easing off tomorrow night. These strong to gale force winds may result in coastal and other infrastructure damage. While the forecast is for light to moderate rainfall over the Cape metropole, there may be periods of heavy downpours in a short period of time, which may lead to localized flooding - especially in informal settlements. Over the past weekend, an intensive cold snap characterised by heavy rains, flooding and strong winds wreaked havoc in parts of the province, while light snow fell on the higher peaks as the mercury dropped. Across the Western Cape trees were uprooted, roofs were blown off buildings and traffic was disrupted. Roads were flooded and power outages were reported in several suburbs. The lower-lying parts of Cape Town, the southern West Coast, Overberg and the winelands were also flooded according to reports. Cape Argus
