Cape Town - What started out to many as a groovy dance-filled surprise for Tyger Valley Centre shoppers, turned out to be a surprise proposal for one lucky lady. On Wednesday, Tyger Valley Centre took to social media and posted a clip of the surprise proposal. The video has more than 3 500 views, and it is still growing. Phoenix Dance Company was roped in to deliver a fun little dance number for the unsuspecting lady of the hour, who was just enjoying the dance while sitting at Cafe Bagaso. Julia Pretorius from Phoenix Dance Company shared insight on the moment: "So today I and some of our Phoenix Dance family participated in a Flash Mob dance at Tyger Valley center for a guy who wanted to propose to his girlfriend. "This was something I never thought I would get the opportunity to partake in and to help make the day special for someone else was amazing! Thank you Phoenix family! We did it despite the stresses and nerves and we did it in style." All of the effort proved worthwhile and helped the unknown couple become engaged.   For a clearer angle, watch here. Cape Argus
