Cape Town - The Department of Social Development has removed 17 children from the Al Noor Child and Youth Care Centre in Woodstock after conducting a preliminary investigation into a number of serious complaints of alleged physical and sexual abuse at the centre. The children have been placed in other child and youth care centres, and are receiving the necessary social support, including assessment and counselling. Criminal charges have also been laid with the SAPS against the alleged perpetrators. Due to the seriousness of the allegations, involving a number of children at the home, the department has deemed it necessary to remove and place the children in temporary alternative accommodation in terms of s173 of the Children’s Act to ensure their safety while criminal investigations are underway. The department will find alternative long term placement for the children. The department is also in the process of suspending the home’s registration pending the final outcome of its investigations into the matter. Cape Argus
