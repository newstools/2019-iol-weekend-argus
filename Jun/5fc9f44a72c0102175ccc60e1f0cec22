Cape Town - One Cape Town taxi driver felt the need, the need for speed when he caught sight of a Formula One car fast approaching in his rear-view mirror. In what could likely be described as the most brazen and hilarious response to seeing an F1 car driving alongside you on the road, the taxi driver put his foot down and increased his speed to keep up with the racing car. Likely seeing the opportunity to fulfil his dream of racing against a professional F1 car, the two cars fast approached the circle on Lower Adderley Street in the Cape Town CBD before the F1 car sailed right past him. The Aston Martin Red Bull Racing team were testing the vehicle ahead of the Red Bull Cape Town Circuit which took place on Sunday. The free event gave thousands of South African fans the chance to witness the thundering power of a Formula 1 car at close quarters. The Grand Parade echoed with the roar of a championship-winning F1 car as David Coulthard took the wheel down Darling Street at the event.   Cape Argus
