Cape Town - A 10-metre Humpback whale carcass has washed ashore south of the black river mouth near the Cape Town harbour. The City of Cape Town said that it is following the necessary procedures to ensure it's removed. The City confirmed that the 10-metre Humpback whale carcass washed ashore on Tuesday evening, 4 June 2019. The normal protocol is for the City of Cape Town to handle the carcass. However, the City stated that it cannot reach the carcass at this stage. "We will keep on monitoring the whale carcass until it is accessible for removal. "The public can be assured that the washed-up carcass near the Cape Town harbour poses no risk to the beach or coastal users. Once the sea moves the carcass to a better location where we can access it, we will remove it," said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Spatial Planning and Environment, Marian Nieuwoudt.
