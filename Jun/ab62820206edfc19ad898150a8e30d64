Johannesburg - A man, believed to be an architect, died after being shot multiple times outside a law firm in Newtown on Tuesday morning. After being shot, the man's lifeless body lay on the pavement, metres away from his car outside the building alleged to be his work place. According to Johannesburg Police spokesperson Constable Moloto Kgatla, allegations are that the man had just parked his car outside his workplace when he was ambushed by an unknown suspect who shot him several times. Kgatla added that after the shooting the suspect jumped into a white motor vehicle and fled the scene. Kgatla confirmed that police opened a case of murder. He said the motive behind the shooting was unknown but that they were investigating. A security guard who was at the scene said he was doing his daily foot patrol when he heard gunshots. “When I got to this side, all I saw was the man lying down in a pool of blood. I am not sure if he had just arrived to work or he was going to his car from the office,” the guard said. Family members of the deceased were also at the scene and could hold hold back the tears as they watched crime scene investigators conduct their work around the deceased's body. They cried harder when they were asked to go to the body and see it for the last time before it was taken away in a mortuary van. They declined to speak to speak to the media. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived at the scene shortly after 8am to find that the man had already succumbed to his injuries. “On further inspection, paramedics found a man lying on the pavement. Assessments showed that the man had sustained several gunshot wounds and showed no signs of life,” Meiring said. The Star
