Warrant Officer Jody Fenner, 29, a police officer of eight years, was a car fanatic from Eastwood in Pietermaritzburg. He liked the events where cars spun around a term called spinning. He was shot dead in the venue’s car park when he tried to stop a fight. Fenner apparently drew his state firearm and fired in the air to scare off those involved in the fighting. It was alleged a civilian responded by firing his private firearm, fatally wounding Fenner and severely wounding his passenger in the process. Fenner sustained multiple bullet wounds in the upper body and was declared dead on arrival at Wentworth Hospital. His friend sustained wounds under his right arm, in the elbow and back, and was in a stable condition. Wentworth CPF chairperson Pastor Donny Anderson said the event had minimal security, while witnesses felt there was adequate security as they were searched on arrival. Ward councillor Aubrey Snyman said: “The event should have had proper security measures in place.” Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Wentworth police were investigating a case of murder and attempted murder.
