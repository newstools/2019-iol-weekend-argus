Durban - The Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSiRA) has suspended the services of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA), a private security service provider based in KwaZulu Natal. In a statement the authority said the immediate suspension was due to alleged misconduct and RUSA still had to answer to the prima facie evidence. "The Authority was thorough in its investigation and this immediate suspension is sustained until the finalisation of the Code of Conduct findings," said Siziwe Zuma. She explained that according to Section 28 of the Code of Conduct any person convicted of misconduct may be liable to a fine or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 24 months. PSiRA CEO, Manabela Chauke said: “There is no amount of decorated reasons purported to be the rationale for harassing people can serve as a pretext for bypassing the requirements of the Constitution and deliberate obfuscation in properly applying the Industry’s Code of Conduct.” To this end, the Authority will not tolerate any apparent deliberate disregard for the industry’s Code of Conduct and will therefore act decisively. But RUSA boss Prem Balram described the suspension as a witch hunt. "We reported a case of corruption against PSiRA, a few security companies and criminal elements who we believe are on a witch hunt to suspend RUSA’s Services. "Our attorneys have been instructed to institute civil claim for reputational damages." POST
