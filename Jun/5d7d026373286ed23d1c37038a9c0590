Cape Town - Melomed Gatesville Hospital have found another way to make their stay of the young patients at the hospital a little less scary. The hospital will allow children to drive battery-operated cars from one ward to another to help them feel better while they are admitted to the hospital. "Internationally, hospitals have introduced battery-operated cars to help ease the anxiety children may face when being hospitalised. At Melomed, we look forward to the excitement of making these cars available within our wards under strict supervision," the hospital said in a statement. "Our little patients will be able to drive themselves from the ward to their place of treatment - from making a pit stop at Pathology or to theatre. "The battery operated cars might not be new to the medical field, but at Melomed we are confident that the Melocares cars will bring excitement to our young patients and ensure their stay will be a memorable one," the hospital said.
