Cape Town - While in town for the Red Bull Cape Town Circuit, the Aston Martin Red Bull Racing gave locals a taste of what it is like seeing an F1 car in action with a fun preview at the V&A Waterfront on Friday. The F1 team were showing off the car ahead of Sunday's Red Bull Cape Town Circuit. The free event is to give tens of thousands of South African fans the chance to witness the thundering power of a Formula 1 car at close quarters. The Grand Parade will echo with the roar of a championship-winning Formula One car as David Coulthard takes the wheel down Darling Street. Motoring fans will marvel at the motorcycle stunt skills of Aruñas “Aras” Gibieža and local trials legend Brian Capper, with Red Bull Air Race pilot Patrick Davidson giving aerial support. The event is scheduled to take place between 12h00 and 17h00 in front of the City Hall. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
