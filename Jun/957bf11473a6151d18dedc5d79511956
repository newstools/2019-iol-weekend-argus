Cape Town - The City of Cape Town said it is doing its best to resolve the impasse that has led to the suspension of the N2 Express service. Daily meetings are being held with the stakeholders from the N2 Express service in an effort to finding a solution that will get the MyCiTi buses back on the road. "We will inform the public once the service is ready to operate again. For now, the N2 Express service, unfortunately, remains suspended until further notice," the City said. "Commuters from Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha should please note that the City is currently refunding MyCiTi passengers who have bought monthly packages for the N2 Express service. The refund is immediate, and in cash." According to the City's records, 154 passengers from Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha have bought monthly packages in advance. "We advise these commuters to please visit the Zone 3 kiosk at the Civic MyCiTi station in Cape Town where they will be required to complete a refund form. As stated above, the refund is immediate and in cash, once they have completed and signed the refund form." The refund service for monthly packages is available between 06:00 and 21:45. The refunds will be paid out at the Civic Centre station until Friday evening, 21 June 2019. Cape Argus
