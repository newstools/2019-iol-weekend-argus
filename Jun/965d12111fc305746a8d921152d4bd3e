Johannesburg - Zindzi Mandela returned to Twitter during President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address to heap praise on the Khoisan imbongi. The poet was Bradley Van Sitters, a Khoi poet, activist and academic. He is understood to be part of the team which contributed to the University of Cape Town's introduction of Khoekhoegowab, an indigenous Khoisan language, as a short course. Mandela, the South African ambassador to Denmark, had been away from Twitter since she came under fire in some quarters for her tweets about ‘Our Land’. “The Khoisan praise singer gave me goosebumps 🙌🙌 and I don't even know what he's saying ow💓,” tweeted former president Nelson Mandela’s daughter. The Khoisan praise singer gave me goosebumps 🙌🙌🙌 and I don't even know what he's saying. Wow💓 Imbongi for this SONA is poet and academic, Mr Bradley Van Sitters. The determination of the Sona Poet, who'll usher President Ramaphosa into the Chamber ahead of his delivery of SONA, was made in conjunction with the Khoisan Council and the House of Tradtional Leaders #SONA2019 pic.twitter.com/vgk9UcxTrK To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

I think it's high time we showed them respect... Why isn’t the Khoisan language not an official language? Khoisan need to be introduced in our curriculum so that some of us can learn it The Khoisan broer could have been dishing out state secrets, but we wouldn't know.😂 #SONA2019 pic.twitter.com/dpM2VyhK92 So the Khoisan people have been represented. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾#SONA2019 I want to learn that Khoisan language 😍😍 #SONA2019 This "Khoisan language" of the poet somehow sounds similar to isiXhosa & seSotho with those clicks.I heard:qhude qwatiayingangathisiyaqhumisa😂😂😂#SONA2019 #Parliament Me when the Khoisan dude was giving praise #SONA2019pic.twitter.com/nfeUkWEY2J #SONA2019 I appreciate the Khoisan language but I heard nothing at all.
