Police spokesperson Andre Traut however said the disciplinary process is yet to be finalised. Esethu Mcinjana, from Blue Downs, was arrested on May 19. The incident was condemned by the SA Human Rights Commission and Cosatu. Mcinjana arrived an hour earlier for a job interview, and was taking selfies while she waited. She was approached by two police officers who accused her of being part of a group who allegedly broke into cars. The officers searched her bag and found a remote gate device inside. She was accused of being in possession of a vehicle-breaking implement. Mcinjana video-recorded the incident and posted it on social media. She spent the night in jail. “Members from the police legal services came to my house on May 29 and took a statement. I also showed them the video I had taken of the incident. They told me I would be informed of the outcome from the investigation. “I’m patiently waiting for a reply and what action they are going to take against the two officers. All that I want is justice for what they have done to me. I’m okay now, and just glad that I got a job,” said Mcinjana. vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
