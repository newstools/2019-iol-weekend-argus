Durban - A failed cash in transit heist in the parking lot of a prominent tile business has raised eyebrows in Durban on Friday. It is alleged that guards got off the cash van belonging to G4S security and collected money boxes from the tile business at the corner of Garth Road and Felix DlaminiÂ (Brickfield) Road. A group of between 3 to 4 robbers then appeared and tried to rob one of the guards but he retaliated by firing several shots at the robbers. The men then fled the scene in an awaiting motor vehicle. Mayville police detectives were at the scene gathering details of what transpired. It is unclear at this stage if any cash boxes were taken or if anyone was shot. Traffic has been diverted away from the busy intersection which is a main public transport corridor to Sydenham and Clare Estate. Ethekwini Secure spokesperson Zain Soosiwala said police had cordoned off the entire area. "We are here to assist the police in tracing the getaway vehicle. From what we gathered the robbers arrived in a Datsun Go," Soosiwala said. Daily News
