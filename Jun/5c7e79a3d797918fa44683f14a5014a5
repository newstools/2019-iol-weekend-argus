Sharief and Imaan De Vries, of Kuils River, are seeking support for a musical benefit show that will be held at the Bellville Civic Centre for their daughter Rania, who also suffers from quadriplegia. “Rania can neither speak or walk and needs her parents to do everything for her,” said the child’s aunt Lamise Inglis, who was instrumental in organising the show. Rania goes for specialised physiotherapy and speech therapy at least once a week, and needs multivitamins and medication, which often causes financial strain on her parents, said Inglis. “Her condition takes a big toll on her parents, not only financially, but also emotionally because they need to make sure that all her needs are met.” The show will feature local artists Madeegha Anders, Ramaine Barreiro-Lloyd, Celeste Dreyer, finalist on The Voice SA season 2 Nuraan Boltman and Kim Gustafson. The show starts at 3pm, and tickets cost R100. “This is the second benefit we’ve had for Rania. The first one was in 2017, which was also held at (the) Bellville Civic Centre. “My husband Ebrahim Inglis will perform and be the MC,” said Inglis. * For more information and tickets to the show, Inglis can be reached at 0828871313.
