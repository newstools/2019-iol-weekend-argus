The Kardashian/Jenner clan are always in the news, whether it's KimÂ Kardashian WestÂ showing off too much flesh, or Kylie Jenner launchingÂ yet another makeup product. This week sister KhloÃ© Kardashian is having her moment in the media limelight. First, she was dragged for her Instagram post detailing how her romance with now ex-boyfriendÂ Tristan Thompson started, and now South Africans have found a reason to point and laugh at the reality star. Although, I doubt she's effected by it at all since it's more of an inside joke that only South Africans will get. KhloÃ© proudly showed off a set of travel bags gifted to her by sister Kourtney Kardashian, who launched her own brand called "Poosh," and sent her sisters a set of travel bags with their initials embossed on the sides of the bags. Now this is where it becomes rather unfortunate for KhloÃ©, whose full name is KhloÃ© Alexandra Kardashian and her initials are "K.A.K". So you can well imagine that when South Africans spotted the "KAK" bags they were in stitches and took to social media to express their thoughts on these bags.     Yo, @khloekardashian - we need to discuss this ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ pic.twitter.com/XlfDwy2VxG     When Khloe Kardashian gets her initials on her bags ğŸ˜‚ #kak pic.twitter.com/8brk0ISHKD     Dear @khloekardashian, stop this kak & get yourself a KIFF bag. pic.twitter.com/8YcKjtB1Ut     @khloekardashian have you figured out why your Poosh bag's initials are making us South Africans giggleğŸ™ŠğŸ™Š
