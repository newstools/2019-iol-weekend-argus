Durban - Keegan Reddy, who rose to fame after a fight between him and friends went viral, has died. Reddy, aged 28, died in a house fire in Seatides, north of Durban, at the weekend. Police are investigating the circumstances around the fire after neighbours claimed that they could hear people fighting just minutes before the fire engulfed the house. CERT Emergency Response Tongaat chairperson, NazirÂ Sadack, said around 10:05pm on Saturday night they were alerted to a house on fire in the area. "When we arrived, we found the neighbours trying to douse the house. Along with another responder, we tried to enter the house but after several attempts we had to abandon our efforts because the fire had spread rapidly. Once the fire brigade arrived and managed to douse the house, we were able to enter and found the man lying in the room," he said. Sadack said most of the house was gutted in the fire. He said there were reports from neighbours about an argument that ensued before the house burnt down. He said police were at the scene and would be investigating further. Many people will remember Reddy from a video that circulated on social media in 2016 where Reddy was seen assaulting a man. The fight was then stopped by a third person.    THE MERCURY
