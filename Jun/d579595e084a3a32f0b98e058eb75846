Cape Town - We've all had those moments of being completely taken for a fool, but sometimes we're lucky enough to get away with no one else knowing about our embarrassment. However, on Wednesday, South Africans decided to confess the funny, cringe-worthy and occasionally appalling ways in which they were played for a fool. From the little white lies our parents would tell us when we were young, to the lies we bought into that our political leaders sold us, and everything else in between. South African tweeps didn't hold back, including the serious and minor ways that they were played:     #HowIWasPlayed I grew up knowing that if I swallowed bubblegum I'd wake up the next day with it growing on my hair😭😔 pic.twitter.com/gXUVzln3l2     #HowIWasPlayed when I was in primary my crush told to close my eyes so she could give me a kiss, I closed them and she slapped me in the face 😭😭 pic.twitter.com/8ONnbsLGyA     #HowIWasPlayed I grew up thinking that a TV gets tired when it's being played the whole day my mom used to shout at me for that 😁 pic.twitter.com/EUubmPuKhh     My friend once stole my economics textbook and helped look for it.
